Data-rich activities provide an opportunity for science and mathematics learners to develop empowering capabilities. Aspects of work with data have been identified as core competencies in both science and mathematics curricular standards and have been the focus of research over the past three decades. While past research on work with data has focused on cognitive outcomes and the development of specific practices at the student and classroom levels, little research has considered learners’ engagement and the conditions that facilitate it. Contemporary engagement theory suggests the importance of considering youths' experiences and provides a framework for understanding and measuring them.

The present study explores learners engagement in work with data in the context of summer STEM programs. The aspects of work with data that are the focus of this study are selected on the basis of past research in science and mathematics education and data science education research. They are a) asking questions, b) observing phenomena, c) constructing measures and generating data, d) data modeling, and e) interpreting findings. Data from measures of learners' engagement is collected through the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) that involves asking learners at random intervals to answer short questions about their engagement to discover profiles of learners' engagement.

The following research questions guide the study: 1) What is the frequency and nature of opportunities for youth to engage in each of the five aspects of work with data in summer STEM programs? 2) What profiles of engagement emerge from data collected via ESM in the programs? 3) How do the five aspects of work with data relate to profiles of engagement? 4) How do youth characteristics relate to profiles of engagement?

These questions are explored in the context of nine summer STEM programs that took place over four week in large cities in the Northeastern United States. 203 learners reported 2,970 responses via short ESM surveys of how engaged they were (cognitively, behaviorally, and affectively, assessed through separate items) and of their perceptions of themselves (their competence) and of the activity (its challenge). Programs were video-recorded, and segments of video associated with ESM responses were qualitatively coded for each of the aspects of work with data. Relations of learners engagement to the aspects of work with data were analyzed using multi-level models. After being coded for work with data, activities were coded in an open-ended fashion to better understand the particular nature of work with data in this study's context.

Findings show that aspects of work with data were fairly common overall, but that work with data was enacted out in varying ways, with many ambitious activities but also others that were more superficial in nature. Six profiles of youth engagement were identified, representing distinct configurations of the five indicators of engagement.  Relations between the engagement profiles and each of the aspects of work with data were minimal. Notable exceptions were the generating data and data modeling were significantly associated with full engagement, where all engagement indicators were simultaneously high. However, while statistically significant, these effects were small. Findings from this study have implications for supporting work with data in informal and formal learning environments and for how researchers can use a person-in-context approach to study engaging in data science in a way that is sensitive to moment-to-moment changes in learners' experience.
