# Discussion

Each of the disciplines that contribute to STEM learning involve work with data and how youth and students work with data in engaging ways is a concern of researchers and practitioners. While past research has focused on what aspects of work with data learners are involved in with respect to work with data, or specific conceptual outcomes from working with data, little research has considered youths’ experience of working with data. In this study, engagement was used as a lens to understand the experience of youth working with data in the context of nine summer STEM programs. In particular, five aspects of work with data, a) asking questions, b) observing phenomena, c) constructing measures and generating data, d) data modeling, and e) interpreting and communicating findings, were identified from video-recordings of the programs. These codes were then used to predict profiles, or distinct groups on the basis of different levels, of youths’ cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and two other variables, youths’ perceptions of challenge and competence. These measures were obtained using an innovative method, ESM, that provides some access to youths’ experience in-the-moment of the activities they were involved in during the program.

Findings indicate that work with data occurs regularly in the programs and that there are some examples of ambitious activities centered on working with real-world data (and examples in which the work with data is not fully aligned with youth-driven work with data). Six profiles of engagement were identified, representing different configurations of engagement. Relations of work with data and youth characteristics (pre-program interest in STEM and youths’ gender and status in terms of being a member of under-represented groups in STEM) were, overall, not strongly related with the profiles of engagement, though some key findings were identified. Generating and modeling data were both related to the most potentially beneficial profile, one characterized by high levels of all five of the variables used to create the profiles. Female youth who were involved in work with data (at the instructional episode level) to a greater extent were also more likely to be fully engaged. This study suggests that work with data has purchase as an organizing set of activities for STEM can have some benefits in terms of understanding the nature of what youth do in summer STEM programs. In addition, this study shows that ESM and engagement can be used to understand youths’ experiences. Data–and who is able to work with data–have important roles in STEM learning and in society; efforts to understand and support learners engaging in these ambitious activities should be encouraged and expanded.

## Key findings related to work with data in summer STEM programs

## Key findings related to engagement

There are different patterns of engagements – I don’t know if this is different from other research or not

## Key findings related to work with data and youth characteristics and their relations to engagement

Strangely, these different patterns of engagement have little to do what is going in terms of working with data, or classroom activities – what does prior research say about this. Seems to be a pretty depressing outcome that activities don’t matter for engagement.

Patterns of engagement are pretty strongly associated with individuals.  It’s not the activitiy, or episode, but just who you are as a person that matters.   Did I read that right?

<!-- You need to do more to suggest alternative explanations for your (mostly null findings). How might the fact that these are summer programs play a role in this? Perhaps you are seeing a restricted range of engagement because there are relatively low stakes, etc., and as such you’re not seeing so much of youth’s engagement being tied to the activities they are doing – kids are just on summer auto pilot and are going to engage in whatever there “default” is regardless of what’s going on around them? To what extent is challenge a factor in these programs?  -->

### Key findings for the frequency and nature of work with data

<!-- I feel like this could all be dealt with in 2 paragraphs – there is a lot of work with data going on, with a mix of student-led activities and instructor led activities. So, on one hand we might expect lots of engagement in these activities. (setting up the point later, that surprise – we don’t see these activities as impacting engagement!) -->

<!-- These findings provide some of the the first information for how frequent work with data is in summer STEM programs. In addition, the findings shed light on the specific, qualitative nature of work with data in these contexts. These findings have implications for how science is taught, both in similar, outside-of-school settings and some value in terms of speaking to the role of work with data during formal, K-12 education settings. In the context of describing these findings, I also highlight how the use of video-recordings of the STEM programs was necessary for being able to make claims about the frequency and nature of work with data during them.  -->

Work with data was found to be common in the summer STEM programs: 170 out of the 236 instructional episodes contained at least one of the five aspects (asking questions, making observations, generating data, data modeling, and interpreting and communicating findings) of work with data. The use of video-recordings of the programs and the strategy of using ESM to select (mostly) random samples of youths' experiences during the programs enabled me to show just how frequent work with data was, and I found that specific aspects of work with data were more or less frequent: Making observations, in some form, occurred during 24% of the program's time, while generating data and communicating findings both occurred during 43% of the instructional episodes. Data modeling, like making observations, was somewhat less frequent (29%), whereas asking questions and generating data, like communicating findings, were relatively more common (38%). 

Given the design and goals of summer STEM programs, these align with what may be expected given past research: Such programs are designed to engage youth in the practices, including and as I argue earlier *especially* those relating to work with data, of STEM domains (Dabney et al., 2012; Elam et al., 2012). Even still, these are the first results of this kind (in terms of the proportion of the time spent in the programs). Using video-recording data and a sampling strategy that can provide insight into the amount of overall time spent was an important component of achieving these findings. While there are not other results of this particular kind, a related, an area of related work concerns other studies that have used the PQA measure. However, studies have (yet) used the version that is adapted for STEM content areas. Some reports call for greater use of measures (such as the PQA) in the study (and evaluation) of summer and outside-of-school STEM programs (e.g., Yohalem et al., 2005). As one example of such a study (but one that is not focused on STEM), Smith et al. (2012) reported findings from a continuous improvement intervention (that used a rigorous experimental design), finding that the intervention positively impacted the quality of instruction in the programs.

In-depth qualitative analysis revealed that there was often a variety of ways in which each of the aspects were carried out, with implications for how youth may engage in each of them. Many times, youth engaged in what can be described as ambitious and potentially highly engaging ways of being involved in work with data. When youth were asking questions, 39% of the time they worked to make predictions or hypotheses about the phenomena they were exploring or the problem they were seeking to solve. When making observations, in 86% of the episodes, they did so of phenomena in the field (such as an estuary or an island in the case of science-focused programs). In mathematics and engineering-focused programs, such observations were of the physical objectsyouth created in workshops or were through computers in classroom settings. 

When generating data, many times (in 47% of the episodes that involved this aspect) youth recorded their own observations; when modeling data, youth were involved (in 72% of the episodes) in the use of statistical and mathematical models of real-world phenomena. When interpreting and communicating findings, youth regularly (during 48% of episodes) had opportunities to share (with other youth in the program) what they found or created as a result of their earlier investigations or work. 

Also of note was what occurred during the rest of the time: When youths' questions, for example, were not focused on predicting or hypothesizing about what they were exploring, type of question was more general, or was instructor-led, rather than driven by youth. Especially for this aspect of work with data (asking questions) as well as when generating data and interpreting and communicating findings, a substantial proportion of the instructional episodes that involved these aspects of work with data were not as ambitious (and not as much in alignment with recent policy documents and curricular standards, i.e. National Research Council, 2012; NGSS Lead States, 2013; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010). In the scientific and engineering practices in the NGSS and the standards for mathematical practice in the Common Core State Standards), work with data is described by grade-level bands. For instances, in grades 6-8, students are expected to that ask questions, for example, to determine relationships between variables and relationships in models (NGSS Lead States, Appendix F, 2015). It is *not* expected that students engage in all of the aspects of a practice at once. However, as McNeill and Berland (2017) argue, it is not just engaging in these practices by rote, but about integrating them, as they overlap and interconnect. 

Also of note was the frequency of these three aspects of work with data overall: They occurred much more frequently than the two (making observations and data modeling) for which a larger proportion of their enactment was more in-line with policy and curricular standards. What this suggests is that while work with data that was ambitious and potentially highly-engaging to youth was found to be common (according to the quantitative analysis), this qualitative analysis showed that there how the aspects of work with data took place varied a lot: The type of activities that may be the most demanding for youth were still common, but not quite as common as the overall frequencies presented for the quantitative would suggest.

While descriptive in nature, these results present the first insight into the extent of work with data in STEM enrichment programs. They suggest that, as past scholarship (National Research Council, 2009, 2012) can provide a context for youth to be involved in the type of scientific and engineering practices-focused activities that can be particularly powerful for youth (and students) in terms of their learning. The use of video-recordings of data was especially helpful in establishing this descriptive data.

The nature of the aspects of work with data in such settings can more easily (than the frequency of the aspects of work with data) be compared to past research. This past research points out the heterogeneity in how work with data is enacted in educational settings. For example, McNeill and Berland (2017). They argue that a view of work with data focused on sense-making with real-world phenomena and iterative cycles of engaging in work with data, and revision of intermediate ideas. In this sense, some of what was observed in the programs aligned with work with data, while others did not. 

Another comparison is other studies investigating data modeling. Past research, for example, highlights use of "data to solve real problems and to ask authentic questions" (Hancock et al., 1992, p. 337). Research on generating data emphasized an aspect not very much the focus of the present research, namely, structuring data into spreadsheets (Konold, Finzer, & Kreetong, 2017; Lehrer & Kim, 2009). Research on posing questions that can be answered with data shows that there is a connection between student-centered teaching strategies and students' ability to ask empirical (Bielik & Yarden, 2016). This suggests a reason why youth were able to ask questions and ideas for how they might do so more: Make activities in summer STEM program youth-centered, rather than instructor-centered. Research on the data modeling aspect of work with data highlights the use of statistical models much more than the physical models which were sometimes found to be a way in which youth engaged in data modeling (Petrosino, Lehrer, & Schauble, 2003; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008; Lee, Angotti, & Tarr, 2010). Nevertheless, many of the ways youth engaged in data modeling aligned with this past research, particularly when the goal of the activity is to model variability. This past research that encouraging youth to consider summaries of data, such as the mean and standard deviation, may be a promising way for them to engage more deeply in data modeling (Lehrer, Kim, & Schauble, 2007; Lehrer & Schauble, 2004). In this way, some (but not all) of the aspects work with data aligned with past research; when they align, they are encouraging, and when they do not, some ideas for how to involve youth in more engaging aspects of work with data are able to be identified.

### Key findings for what profiles of engagement were found

<!-- Too long by 50% -->

<!-- These findings provide insight into how youth experience engagement together and at once. By together and at once, I refer to the profile approach used that was used to identify common groups of youths' responses. This approach provides information about youths' engagement that is different from that gained from other approaches. -->

Six profiles of engagement were found using a rigorous model selection approach. Before discussing these results in-depth, it is important to note that LPA is an exploratory approach: The number and nature of the profiles identified were found through a rigorous and systematic approach, but this is not a guarantee that the same number and make-up of profiles would emerge.
[fix me - in what sample? context? in this sample again? clarify]

[fix me - flesh this out a bit better - make the comparisons more explicit]
Six is, in the context of these possible caveats, the same number of profiles of engagement identified in recent, past research and the similar number provides further information about the nature of engagement in educational contexts. Schmidt et al. (2018) found six profiles of engagement. Their profiles were constructed on the basis of the indicators (cognitive, behavioral, and affective) of engagement, and not perceptions of challenge and competence. Namely, six is a number of profiles that is larger than the number of profiles identified in other fields (see Wormington and Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2017, for a review in motivational settings). However, as large as six profiles is, it is not a number that is far higher than the average, suggesting that there may be a greater variety of types of engagement exhibited than, for example, types of motivation. 

In terms of the make-up of the specific profiles, those found in the present study included those that were strongly negative (*Universally low*) and strongly positive (*Full*), as well as those characterized by different levels of engagement (*Only behavioral* and *Only affective*) and by different levels of the conditions of engagement (Engaged and Competent but not Challenged). An *All moderate* profile was also identified. Little research has examined profiles of engagement, though Schmidt et al. (2018) examined profiles of engagement, constructed from items for cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement (but not perceptions of challenge and competence), and found six profiles, some of which partially overlap with those found in the present study. In particular, on the basis of the items shared between the studies, a *Universally low*, *All moderate*, and *Full* profile were found in both studies. However, as these profiles are characterized by the (uniform) level across all of the variables, this is only limited evidence for the presence of these profiles in the larger population of youth engaged in science and STEM-related learning activities.

These profiles have implications for the study of engagement and the analysis of multidimensional data on youth and student engagement. First, they suggest that perceptions of challenge and competence be considered in future research. This is because some of the profiles were distinguished on their basis. This approach also may be more parsimonious than including perceptions of challenge and competence as separate predictors (i.e., Shernoff et al., 2003). In addition to these empirical reasons, past research on engagement (i.e., Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) and on the profile approach (Bergman & Magnusson, 1997) suggest that they are theoretically inseparable from engagement, another reason for modeling them as they were modeled in the present study. These implications are specific to the study of engagement but also highlight some of the promise of the profile approach, as well.

### Key findings for sources of variability for the profiles

<!-- This needs to be shortened and woven into some other section -->

<!-- These findings help us to understand how much variability in youths' engagement can be attributed to variables: both those that are measured in this and related studies and those that are not or cannot be measured at different levels, namely youth, instructional episode, and program. What these findings suggest about what relations can be anticipated from predictors at different levels is discussed, as well as how researchers can use null models as used in the present study to understand variability at different levels. -->

The profiles suggest that the experiences of youth in summer STEM programs are variable and that the use of ESM can aid in the study of youths' engagement. The source of this variation can be due to many different factors, including individual differences between youth, the nature of the instruction carried out, and program-specific factors: Knowing about these sources provide valuable information in their own right, a benefit of the use of mixed effects models (Gelman & Hill, 2007). 

The findings for this question were somewhat surprising and disappointing given past research. In particular, youth-level sources of variability were by far the largest, explaining between .093 to .432, depending on the profile: This means that between around 10% and 40% of the unexplained variability in the profiles is attributable to youth characteristics, both those that can be captured with variables and those that are at the youth level but are not measured (or are not measurable but are still at this level). Furthermore, the amount of variability at the instructional episode and program levels was small, no greater than .031 for the instructional episode or .023 for the program. A promise of the use of ESM is that it is able detect contextual differences in youths' experiences: The small amount of variability that can be explained at this level suggests that, for the engagement profiles, not much difference exists from instructional episode to instructional episode. 

This finding related to minimal variability at the program and particularly at the instructional episode level is useful in its own right. It also suggests that engagement, as measured in this context with ESM and with the engagement items used, may be more stable than dynamic at the instructional episode level, differing from some past theory (e.g., Skinner & Pitzer, 2012) and research that showed relations between instructional episode-level variables and engagement (e.g., Shernoff et al., 2016; Shumow, Schmidt, & Zaleski, 2013). This also suggests that variables at these levels do not have a substantial proportion of variability to explain: Predictor variables (like those for the aspects of work with data) at the instructional episode level had much less variability to explain, while those at the youth level had a substantial amount that was able to be explained. 

One factor of note concerns the analytic approach used. As noted, the profiles demonstrated very little variability at the program and instructional episode level, suggesting that factors at this level would likely not strongly predict the profiles. This could be a function of the use of profiles and the specific variables selected. It may also be the result of the outcome (engagement and its conditions) selected. Other analytic approaches can be carried out to determine the viability of the profiles approach and use of the items for engagement and its conditions for understanding work with data.

[fix me - other explanations]
<!-- How might the fact that these are summer programs play a role in this? Perhaps you are seeing a restricted range of engagement because there are relatively low stakes, etc., and as such you’re not seeing so much of youth’s engagement being tied to the activities they are doing – kids are just on summer auto pilot and are going to engage in whatever there “default” is regardless of what’s going on around them? To what extent is challenge a factor in these programs?  -->

While these are important limitations, it is worth noting that the modeling strategy (with the mixed effects models) is inherently a conservative (particularly in terms of the statistical significance of hypothesis tests) approach. Thus, while the findings detected are small, they can be considered to be trustworthy on the basis of the way the ESM data were analyzed. This trustworthiness is enhanced by the use of sensitivity analysis, which showed how much of the effects could be due to bias for them to be invalidated.

### Key findings for how work with data relates to engagement 

<!-- Shorten - and discuss practical significance -->

<!-- These findings show minimal but important relations between the aspects of work with data and youth engagement. They are discussed in the context of past research on work with data and youth engagement in scientific and engineering practices more generally. Finally, some possible reasons for the minimal findings are brought up. -->

In line with what the preliminary analysis of the amount of variability that could be explained at the youth, instructional episode, and program levels, relations between work with data were largely not found, though some small, statistically significant relations were identified. These findings, overall, were not necessarily surprising given past research: The question of whether and how work with data relates to engagement has not been the focus of any past research. In this sense, these are important findings that suggest that work with data may not be strongly related to engagement. 

Given the small amount of variability at the instructional episode level, this result was anticipated (on this basis). Importantly, however, there were some noteworthy findings. In particular, both generating and modeling data were found to be positively (and statistically significantly) related to the *Full* profile, suggesting that when youth are involved in these practices, then they are more likely to be highly engaged. In particular, given the makeup of this profile, this suggests that when youth are involved in these aspects of work with data, they are more likely to report high levels of cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and high perceptions of competence and challenge. The effect of data modeling was more robust than that for generating data, the latter which should be interpreted with caution. In short, this suggests that these activities are beneficial to youths' engagement. 

Say more on modeling.

Say more on generating.

As there is no research on how work with data relates to youths' engagement, the findings associated with this research question provide some, albeit limited, evidence (and directions for future research) for how some aspects of work with data relate to youths' engagement. As work with data is a core component of new visions for STEM learning (see the scientific and engineering practices that are part of the NGSS and the standards for mathematical practice in the CCSS), these findings provide some insight into how involvement in a subset (focused on work with data) of these practices relates to engagement. Particularly, the relatively minimal findings suggest that these activities may not be more engaging *per se*. Instead, it may be the way that youth engage in them that matters, in alignment with past research (Berland et al., 2017; Miller et al., in press). 

While the findings for this question were somewhat minimal, there are key findings from both the important relationships that were found to be statistically significant (between generating data and data modeling and *Full* engagement) and from those that were not. Finding few significant findings may show that, in this sample and with work with data as carried out, it is difficult to say with certainty just how much of an impact work with data has upon youths' engagement. This suggests that other samples, other enactments of work with data, and, possibly, other analytic approaches can build on this work to further substantiate what is known about how work with data is engaging to youth.

### Key findings for how youth characteristics relate to engagement

<!-- These findings, more surprising given the amount of variability able to be explained by variables at the youth level and the minimal relations, are discussed, followed by some reasons for why there are not more (and stronger) relations. -->

First, the relations between youth characteristics and the profiles were found to be small and not as much in line with expectations given the preliminary analysis. These small relations were similar (in magnitude) to those between work with data and the profiles, but they were more surprising for a reason related to the sample for this study, namely, given the substantial variability at the youth level among the responses. This is described in detail in the discussion of the findings for research question #3. 

Findings for this question revealed that youth with higher pre-program interest were more likely to be *Engaged and competent but not challenged*. This suggests that youth with higher interest in STEM are inclined to be highly engaged and good at what they are doing, but are not challenged by the activities they experience. This finding is in line with past research suggesting a relationship (direct or as a moderator) between youth characteristics (including interest) and their engagement (Shernoff et al., 2003; Shernoff et al., 2016; Strati et al., 2017). More specifically, this finding suggests that for youth who are particularly interested (and those who choose to attend) summer STEM programs, what they are involved in may not challenge them very highly. This finding has implications for past research that shows youth who choose to attend summer STEM programs are more engaged (but that does not speak to their degree of challenge; Beymer, Rosenberg, Schmidt, & Naftzger, 2018). 

In terms of youths' gender, the analysis for this question revealed that female youth who are engaged in work with data *may* be (note that this result was not statistically significant) more likely to be fully engaged. While this finding cannot be interpreted on the basis of the results from this study, given that past research has found that female students are less likely to be engaged in STEM classes (e.g., Patall et al., 2017), it suggests that this relationship between gender and youths' engagement be considered further in follow-up studies. At present, we have limited information about what types of instruction may best support female students to be engaged and successful both in summer STEM and other settings.

While the findings for this research question, like those for the relations between the aspects of work with data and youths' engagement, they provide some information about how these characteristics relate to youths' engagement. Finding that youth who are more interested prior to the beginning of the summer STEM programs are more likely to be working hard, learning something new, and enjoying what they are learning, and perceive themselves to be good at what they are doing but not challenged, is a meaningful finding. Moreover, the null findings suggest that other characteristics, including those measured but not included for this analysis (such as youths' pre-program perceptions of their competence) as well as those not measured at all, may be considered in follow-up studies and in future research.

## Limitations of the Study and Recommendations for Future Research

This study examines youths' engagement as an outcome. Accordingly, outcomes from engaging, such as the products of neither youths’ work or the specific cognitive capabilities they develop through their participation, are not the focus. Thus, while some findings about how work with data and youth characteristics were found to be associated with different profiles of engagement, we do not have an understanding of how engaging in more or less adaptive ways relates to these outcomes. Examining how work with data and engagement relate to key learning, motivational, and future goals and plans-related outcomes is a topic for future research.

Another limitation concerns the context of the study, summer STEM programs. While the programs that were involved in the study have many affordances for work with data and for being highly engaging for youth, they have some limitations, too, particularly with respect to support work with data. Importantly, these were not programs explicitly designed to support work with data; while such contexts are being developed, they are not yet widespread. Learning environments that deliberately support work with data over a long period may demonstrate different patterns of engagement than those examined in this study because of the focus on and sequencing of the aspects of work with data, which may make it more (or less) cognitively, behaviorally, or affectively engaging than is determined in this study. As Miller et al. (2018) highlight, truly engaging STEM activities are not easily come by; they require students to take ownership over and to make decisions about their explorations or designs. Thus, future research may study work with data in contexts designed to support it. A key part of this future research may be studying both work with data and how work with data is supported (most importantly by the instructor but also by the curriculum and technological tools).

A related limitation is that the programs that were the focus of this study were model programs, or those based on characteristics of exemplary STEM enrichment programs. As a result, engagement may be different in other STEM enrichment programs depending on characteristics of the programs and their activities, and findings from this study should be interpreted in terms of programs that share similar characteristics.

It is possible that the somewhat minimal findings are, in part, a result of the analytic approach. A similar mixed effects modeling approach has only been used in one other study (Strati et al., 2017), and that approach did not use profiles (as in this study) as the outcome. In this study, little variability at the instructional episode level was found, and so minimal relations between factors at this (instructional episode) level and the profiles of engagement was expected. Might profiles, but not the variables used to create them, be less variable at the instructional episode level? One way to consider such an alternate explanation is to use the data used in this study as part of a correlational analysis, or another analysis that uses that variables used to create profiles of engagement but does not use the profiles themselves.

A final limitation concerns the measures used for work with data.

Work with data can be difficult to measure [fix me!] because there are multiple levels at which youth can do this.

Need a scale score

Did not evaluate reliability very well.

The dimensions of the STEM-PQA measure aligned closely with the aspects of work with data. But, there were some possible divergences that may have had an impact upon some of the findings. For example, for the interpreting and communicating findings code, the STEM-PQA codes for *Analyze* ("Staff support youth in analyzing data to draw conclusions ") and *Use symbols or models* ("Staff support youth in conveying STEM concepts through symbols, models, or other nonverbal language") were used. In the case of the latter STEM-PQA code, conveying STEM concepts through symbols, models, or other nonverbal language could have reflected instructional episodes in which youth used, for example, mathematical equations or formulas, but did not do so as part of modeling data of a phenomena in the world: They could have simply been using an equation outside of the context of any particular phenomena. Future research may consider use of coding for this aspect of work with data (and this aspect of science curricular standards in particular; see NGSS Lead States, 2013).

As another example of this limitation, generating data was an aspect of work with data that the open-ended qualitative analysis revealed to be less associated with less systematic groups of practices, or themes, than the other aspects. The STEM-PQA codes corresponding to this aspect of work with data were *Collect data or measure* ("Staff support youth in collecting data or measuring") and *Highlight precision and accuracy* ("Staff highlight value of precision and accuracy in measuring, observing, recording, or calculating "). Particularly in the case of the latter code, the emphasis on precision and accuracy may have been outside of activities focused on recording data or creating coding frames. Future research may consider a coding frame that is (even more) focused on generating data, though considerations of precision and accuracy are key aspects of doing so, and so perhaps separating the act of generating data from considerations that are important to keep in mind while doing it may be a promising direction for future research. 

While these divergences in measures were not large, they suggest that the coding frame for work with data is a limitation of the present study. McNeill and Berland (2017) describe a similar type of disagreement across science education settings: While a limitation, the coding frame did represent agreement across a range of studies across STEM contexts for the aspects of work with data, although I recognize that this coding frame may not distinguish the different ways in which work with data is enacted, as 
revealed by the qualitative coding carried out in this study.

## Implications for Practice

Two key implications related to engaging youth in generating and modeling data and including other practices to the extent that they involve youth in generating and modeling are discussed. This is based on the increases in full engagement when youth are involved in these activities, all else being equal. While this is somewhat limited evidence, this study suggests that *generating data* and *modeling data* in particular may be beneficial in terms of engaging youth. Generating data in particular may be a key practice because it involves making work with data concrete; as Lehrer and Schauble (2015) describe, recording data in the form of "inscriptions" can serve as commitments that youth make (in terms of what data were chosen to be collected and recorded). This implication, in particular, should be interpreted with caution, however, given the very small magnitude of the effect. Similarly, data modeling has been described as *the* central scientific and engineering practice (Schwarz et al., 2009; Lehrer & Schauble, 2015; Weisberg, 2012), and its relations with full engagement provides some actionable evidence for its importance in the context of summer STEM programs.

Practically, youth activity leaders (in summer STEM and other STEM enrichment contexts) and teachers (in formal learning environments) can best include the beneficial practices of generating and modeling data not in isolation, but rather through involving youth and learners in complete cycles of investigation. This aligns with both foundational and contemporary research on work with data in education (Berland et al., 2018; McNeill & Berland, 2017; Hancock et al., 1992; Lee & Wilkerson, 2018). Recent curricular reform efforts also suggest that the best way to engage learners in particular practices is through the process of identifying a question or problem, marshaling sources of data that can be used to figure out what is happening, and developing model-based explanations that are then communicated (or even used in an argument; National Governors Association, 2013; National Research Council, 2012; NGSS Lead States, 2013). With respect to work with data in particular, youth activity leaders and teachers can use the findings from this study as a starting point to consider how engaging in work with data may also prepare learners to think of, understand, and take action based on data in their day-to-day lives. Many questions or problems learners face may involve data that can be meaningfully incorporated into engaging learning activities.

## Implications for the development of open source tool

A final note concerns how the modeling was carried out. Because LPA is an exploratory approach, it requires a blend of exploring the data while also systematically taking account of how the solutions change while different solutions are explored. Because of the challenge of doing this, I developed an open-source tool that made it easier to work toward the aim of systematically exploring the data. Other educational researchers may consider the utility of such development efforts, though such efforts are not a regular part of the products created in the course of most educational research. Such development work by educational researchers may even inform the type of activities youth do when working with data: While a STEM content area, programming and computer science-related activities were not emphasized as much as those related to science, mathematics, and engineering.
