1,Boston - Dorchester House,2015-07-14,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,2,"-the students are filling out a sheet individually (seems to be a quiz to determine how much students already know, but that is just a guess)
-it looks like the teacher is filling out one too?
-so it's a math sheet that includes word problems about ratios
-students are asked to volunteer and write their answer on the board (sharing findings)
-generating data must have been coded for the ""data"" students generated being their answers to the math problem
-the teacher then goes over the answers with the entire class
-NOTE: this video is 18 minutes long",HM,
1,Boston - Dorchester House,2015-07-14,2,,,,,,0,0,"-the students are listening to the teacher give a lesson on ratios
-(the teacher's audio cuts in and out on this video)
-at 3:40 the audio cut out completely which may be why they did not code this video
-so I see the students are measuring themselves (generating data?) but because there is no audio I do not know what the purpose is
-they then go back to writing on their papers (no way of knowing what is on the paper with no audio)",HM,

-he asks their opinions on the audio samples (but the students aren't saying much)
-this seems to be an introduction to a project they will be doing (making their own songs)
-the teacher shows them examples from previous years (which are actually pretty good!) and it seems like they can work on these in groups",HM,
1,Boston - Dorchester House,2015-07-15,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,2,"-looks like students are doing another math worksheet (I think about graphing)
-The students are generating data in tables and a double line graph based on the information they gathered (through a survey I think) 
----at least one of the students gathered information about whether people like Trey Songz or Chris Brown (but I don't know if they all gathered the same type of information)
----so far the teacher has called the graph a double line graph, double number graph, number line graph
-one of the students asks what the next step of their assignment is, and the teacher (pretty much) tells him to stay on task
-the teacher wanted to use excel to graph their data but not all (if any) of the computer has microsoft excel so the students are looking up pictures instead (the pictures relate to a class assignment, but I'm not sure how)

----the team that finishes correctly gets the choice of whether the teacher will bring in brownies, cupcakes, or cookies
----so the students have to take a recipe that serves 20 people and figure out what measurements to use for ingredients to serve specific amounts of people (the amount of people in their class, the amount of people in the summer camp, etc.) and then they have to explain what they did on the poster board

-students are transferring picture they drew to triangular pieces of felt (they are meant to be banners, similar to ones you see for universities) about what they want to be when they grew up
----the students are also able to add things to their banners besides the drawings
-""what's the next step on your road to success?""
-they are asking questions about themselves, and reflecting on what they want to do when they get older, but not asking about science (though one student said she wanted to be a nurse, which is science related)

should we maybe watch the video right before and code that as ESM4? ",HM,
1,Boston - Dorchester House,2015-07-22,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,3,"-the students are pasting pictures to a giant sheet of paper (presumably the pictures they printed out earlier in the program?)
-the video only focuses on the teacher, so it's unclear what the students are doing (but you can see AND hear the teacher eating)
-I guess the project is about they're research (I think the one before where they were surveying opinions. some did music artists, looks like some did shoes, some did cars)",HM,

-each student is assigned to a group that is in charge of a particular step in the baking(?) process
-the students are signaled at 5 minutes and then they mostly seem to be goofing around after that
-so I'm fairly certain they're making cookies (the instructor said something about cookie dough)
-I think this process is connected to their assignment with the baking ratios (but really it's just a way to get them engaged)",HM,
1,Boston - Dorchester House,2015-07-22,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,"-the cookie dough is all mixed together, then the two groups will take turns putting the dough onto baking sheets

-the class splits in two groups for a competition, the teacher asks the students to assign one person as scribe
-he gives them a riddle, ""two fathers and two sons sat down to eat eggs for breakfast. They ate exactly three eggs, each person had an egg.""
-One person is the grandfather (I definitely did not figure that out before them)
-the teacher decides to give them another riddle (are they just passing time? doesn't seem to be math or science related)
----I take that back, he said the second riddle was more math related and it did require some ratio work but the signal goes off and cuts the video before the students start to solve the riddle",HM,

-one of the students is selected to rap the song they wrote, but struggles to find his flow a little bit
-after struggling for a bit, the group decides to remix a song that already exists instead of doing their original piece and decide on ""See You Again"" which is in one of the Fast and Furious movies",HM,

1,Boston - Dorchester House,2015-07-29,3,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,"-so apparently this is their cooking class, and today they are making apple pie
-one student said they are allergic to apples and cinnamon but the teacher disregards them and assumes they are joking (which I think they are, but we can't be sure)
-so is the making of food being coded as generating data?
-each student is assigned a different job (i.e. peelings apples, cutting them up, mixing the dry ingredients)",HM,
1,Boston - Dorchester House,2015-07-29,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,"-they are still in the kitchen (I guess they're waiting for the pie to bake?)

-not sure why this video is coded for observing but not the last one",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-14,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,3,"-there are three instructors in the room
-the students are quietly working on an assignment individually and the teacher has set a timer for five minutes
-They are using a series of numbers written on the board and need to use various forms of math to make the value 10
-the students are asking questions in order to try to get hints on how to solve the problem
-the students then swap papers with another classmate to check their work, they get five minutes
-this clip is coded as generating data (but in my opinion, the data is already given to them aka the numbers on the board, and they are just manipulating the data)
-the table groups add up their individual scores and the groups that get the most are given red raffle tickets (which is likely their form of reward currency in this program)",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-14,2,1,0,1,1,1,1,4,"-the male teacher (Mr. B) gives his answer for the problem on the board, and the student are meant to check his answer (he got it wrong, but I'm not sure if that was intentional. it seems like it was?)
---- (problem was 253-947= -866)
----a student volunteer (Joe) is asked to go up to the board and show why the answer is wrong, he needs to show his work
----Joe flips the problem to be 987-253 = 734 and then made it negative
-the students are communicating findings by showing their work on the board and discussing why their answer was correct and Mr. B's was wrong and also observing their classmate's work and how they solved the problem
-the teacher suggests using a number line to find the answer and a student pushes back, saying it is not practical because the numbers are too big
----the teacher then asks them if the number line has to go by 1's and when some students say no, she asks them to give examples of what a number line can be on a scale of (they reply 5's, 10's, 2's) and the teacher asks why they're moaning and groaning then
-the students begin discussing how Mr. B got the numbers he did, and a student goes up to the board to explain what he did",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-14,3,1,0,1,1,1,1,4,"-in the beginning in the video we catch the tail end of the teacher demonstrating the answer for the last problem they were working on and showing her work
-she says they were going to do ""my favorite no"" activity but everyone got the problem correct so they couldn't choose a ""no"" to look at
-instead, they are playing a game called, ""if, then""
----there are cards with equations and numbers on them, so they need to read the ""if ....."" card with the equation and link it to the card with the number of the answer
-they ask questions but nothing seemingly relevant to the topics (more like, ""are we going to get a prize for this?"") and I don't see anywhere that I would see as communicating findings??
-the video ends before they actually start the activity",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-14,4,1,0,1,1,1,1,4,"-this video is the students actually participating in the ""if, then"" activity

-the students are making some sort of poster or banner for the wall in their classroom (they are currently spelling out ""equation"")",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-16,2,1,0,1,0,1,1,3,"-the students are working on a similar task as the beginning of the day yesterday (they are given a series of numbers and are asked to solve for the target number as many ways as possible (they can use any sort of math to get there aka division, exponents, etc.) in their table groups and there is a timer on the board
----they don't have to use all the numbers given but if they use all the numbers in their problem they get two points instead of one
-Ms. Jackson asks one student why she has stopped working and the student tells her that it is boring 
----Ms. J asks if she can work with the student and asks why she thinks it's boring. The student tells her it's too complicated so Ms. J starts talking through the problem with her
----They realize that the student actually had been on the right track all along
-after the timer runs out they swap papers with another table to ""grade"" them
-one student is supervising his graders to make sure they don't make any mistakes (evidently he really wants the points, which makes sense since the winning table(s) get raffle tickets and the raffle is the next day)",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-16,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,"-they are doing an activity called ""hippity hoppity""

----first the teacher gives some examples of how to combine like terms before they begin the activity
----the teacher splits them into four groups 
----students are trying to hop to the other line (150cm away) and one hop = h, so for every hop it takes to get to the finish line is another h
----ex: 2 hops to get to the end is 2h=150 and then they have to solve for h

2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-16,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,"-the teacher is using students as an example to explain solving an equation (teacher = modeling)
-this is a continuation of the hopping activity (they are using equations to find the distance of one hop aka unit rates)
-The teacher gives them to solve the equations but the students let her know that they have already solved them
-the teacher asks students to volunteer to write their equation on the board and show the class how they solved them (communicating findings)
-because the students are explaining the distance of their hops through equations I would say that could be (data modeling)

----""Oh my goodness, Sean, do you want some cheese with that whine?""
-they are playing ""name that number"" and normally they work in groups and do a lot of talking, but today they need to be completely silent and have to work on it individually, then later they will work together to put their answers down on one paper for the group
-one student asks to move his seat because he does not think he will be able to keep from talking to the other students (the teachers tell him to simply exercise self control, but both are laughing, this is not a very serious conversation but still important)
-this is the same exercise that we have seen in many of the other videos (with the random numbers that they need to use to get the target number) and now it shows that the random numbers are drawn from a bucket
----the target number is also drawn from the bucket
-the students are pretty good about remaining silent but you can see some of them gesturing and mouthing to each other in the video (and they seem to be joking about something rather than trying to discuss the material)
-the video pans onto the board and stays there (I started trying to solve for the target number and realized that this activity is actually harder than I thought)
",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-21,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,"-I believe at the beginning of the video they are doing the group portion of the previous activity

-students begin volunteering to share their solutions on the board (communicating findings)

",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-23,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,3,"-the students look like they are working individually on problems that are on the board (but I'm not sure what they are specifically working on)
-they must be solving equations because the teacher asks a student about like terms
-one student asks for help but the teacher tells him that he needs to at least try it first (he just opened the paper and immediately said he didn't know what to do) but that does mean he is asking questions?
----the teacher starts asking the student guiding questions in order to help him start to solve the problem on his own (with a little help)
-when he is still struggling the teacher brings out the colored chips to help him figure the problem out more visually
-the students are mainly working diligently by themselves (occasionally a teacher will help them with a problem)
-one of the students was absent so the teacher asks the people at his table to help catch him up (and they do so without complaint)",HM,
2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-23,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,"-the students are working on equations that are projected onto the front screen (generating data?)
-they must be inbetween tasks because they are discussing this notion of a part of Chicago being called ""Shiraq"" because there are so many murders/shootings there and also mention how people say those types of things about Dorchester (being Die-chester)
-the teacher is doing something at her desk and the students remain fairly quiet (so I guess maybe they were still working previously but the conversation was more of a side note)
-the paper they are working on is called a ""pyramid"" and (it seems to be about proportions) they are meant to turn in the paper to their teacher when they're done
-one of the students is asking the teacher questions in order to get support solving the problems on her sheet
----Ms. Jackson demonstrates to this student how to solve a problem, while the student observes
-wow it looks like the teachers have had the students set up their notebooks with a table of contents and activities on specific page numbers
----right now the students are copying a blank worksheet onto pages 14 and 15 of their notebook (I appreciate how structured this summer program is, and the teacher maintains much more control of the class than some of the other programs that lacked this much structure i.e. down city design)

-they seem to be workin goff of a worksheet of some sort
-they're asking questions in order to figure out how to solve the problems
-one of the students finished working on whatever the current task is and then was asking the teacher what else she could do (good student, I was suprised by this student taking that initiative)
-the teacher admits that she failed on this activity because the students are not enagaged in learning as much as she hoped and they're not getting as much out of it as planned
----she wants them to learn systems of equations next week but they still are not comfortable with regular solving equations so she wants them to keep working on that
-she writes out the x's and numbers on the board (5x is xxxxx, 5 would be +++++) and then she goes back and forth for each step, one with the written out numbers and one with the regular method of solving equations while the students observe",HM,

-the students are all silent, they each come up to the board when they think of something and write it silently (this is their morning warm up activity)
-she asks the students how many of them love fractions and a few of them raise their hands (I was surprised until she asked if any of them cooked, and the same girl that is shown raising her hand raises her hand for enjoying cooking)
-Ms. Jackson then gives a few more examples once the students cannot think any more (I would count the things written on the board and the discussion as communicating findings)
-the teacher asks them why they think she has them do that ""name that number"" activity every day before today (the activity where they have to solve for the target number)

-Ms. Jackson writes the slope-intercept form equation on the board (y=mx+b) and asks if any of the students know what it is and one or two of the students actually do recognize it
-one student even can fill in the equation based on the line/points they've already plotted on the graph
-Ms. Jackson explicitly says they need to copy the equation down in their notebooks and label all the parts along with the information they previously talked about with slope (m = rise/run, etc)

2,Boston - Mathpower,2015-07-28,4,0,1,1,1,1,1,4,"-the students are curious about what happens if they try to sleep in a high school class and Ms. Jackson is honest and tells them that if the class is large the teacher may not keep trying to keep them awake and they'd get away with it, but also lets them know that it would be harming themselves
-next they begin the activity and she plays a video of someone demonstrating graphing (observing) 
----he draws a pretty cool visual that shows a way to think about describing lines as positive, negative, or zero
----Ms. Jackson cuts off the video and gives them sheets where they need to find the slope of each line for the even number problems

----they almost move on but someone mentions the hypotenuse so Ms. Jackson decides they need to take that opportunity to explore the term
----a student asks if they should add this to their vocab list in their notebook (it's nice to see the students taking initiative and that the teacher is exploring what the students are interested in)

-They are using these examples to brainstorm ideas to propose for their own design (not sure whether they will actually build this later or just conceptualize the space through blueprints or a model)
-this was coded for communicating findings (which is likely because the coders mark demonstrating concepts using a model, in this case the photos, are coded as such)

-maybe I need to see that chart of the specific definitions of criteria the coders were using for these videos again

-the teacher is showing students a 3D model they built on a computer program and allowing students to observe and ask questions about the model (which again is not coded for in this video)
-so eventually the students will be actually building a structure outside of a school (I see now that the popsicle stick activity was the teacher scaffolding student learning about building structures so that they can transfer that knowledge of gluing popsicle sticks together to nailing boards together)

-they are asking each other questions to try to figure out how to build the model
-one of the students is frustrated that his partner is not cooperating with the project. He is in the director position and is meant to give the builder directions, but their builder did not understand the instructions so he gave up and started building whatever
----the teacher noted the director's frustration, but kept telling him that he is not allowed to talk since he is the director, which frustrated him further (she did however talk to the builder after the director walked away and tried to get him to start working again)

-the teachers don't communicate with each other super well, and students often get yelled at by one teacher for doing what another told them to do
----one student had the idea to only have one of them go around to the door that was unlocked so they could unlock the closer door from the inside for everyone else to get in. One of the teachers approved this idea and sent him to open the door, but it turns out the administrators could just buzz them in.
