Viewing engagement in work with data in terms of engagement can help us to build the knowledge base around key data analytic practices for learners. In STEM settings, being engaged predicts key learning-related outcomes (Sinatra et al., 2015). As a consequence, what learners are thinking, feeling, and doing while engaged in work with data, and how challenged or good at data doing any or all of the aspects of work with data they perceive themselves to be, may important predictors of key outcomes and learnersâ€™ preparation for future learning (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999), especially for learning in data-rich areas of studies and occupations, such as data science. Engaging in work with data may also prepare learners to think of, understand, and take action based on data in their day-to-day lives.
