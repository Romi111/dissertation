##### Summer STEM programs as a context for work with data

Summer STEM program have affordances and constraints work with data. Thus, different from the previous theme that was focused on a study-related issue, this theme concerns differences in the nature of the instruction and learning opportunities that learners experienced as part of their time in the summer STME programs.

##### Affordances

Affordances included the community setting and the relevance of the program to youth's lives.

For example, in the *Marine Investigators*, youth participated in activities designed to help them understand water quality in their ecosystem. Youth collected trash from sites around their community (in different "districts") and then brought the trash and recyclable plastic back to the classroom. Then, the youth activity leaders asked students to figure out how much plastic enters local waterways. As a part of this activity, youth activity leaders asked students not only to determine the quantity of trash that entered the waterways, but asked students about *why* they used math in particular ways (i.e., adding the quantity of trash collected and then extrapolating from this quantity to the amount from across the entire city over the course of the year). This appeared to be a powerful activity, one that was coded as involving all five aspects of work with data according to the measures for instructional support for work with data; this type of activity seemed to suggest that instructional support for work with data may impact youth's engagement.

Another affordance concerned the relevance of the program to youth's lives. For example, in the *Building Mania* program, youth are involved in engineering design (i.e., identifying a problem and designing a solution), particularly around the use of simple machines. In a day in the classroom setting, youth are creating, testing, and revising catapults. In the next day, youth visit an area University, and are led in a discussion by a physicist who works with particle colliders. In this example, the expertise of the physicist, who explicitly mentions the benefits of engaging in the engineering design process and the importance of combining engineering to addressing problems (such as mitigating the damage of earthquakes), seems to be highly relevant to what youth are doing in their class. In these two days of class, youth are engaged in different aspects of work with data as indicated by the codes for instructional support for work with data (collecting data on the efficacy of their designs in the classroom day, and asking questions in the subsequent day, particularly); these seem to suggest, like the example of work work with data from the *Marine Investigators* program, affordances of work with data for summer STEM programs.

##### Constraints

Constraints included the challenge of linking activities as a part of a complete cycle of investigation and an emphasis on different aspects of work with data as part of programming.

Youth activity leaders faced challenges linking activities as part of a complete cycle of investigation. For example, in the *Ecosphere* program, youth collected water samples in the field. They then brought these samples to the classroom and tested the water, involving students in both collecting and, to a degree, generating data (by noting the pH levels of the water). However, later in the day, youth created a small-scale model (with inclined trays of dirt, rocks, and plants) of an ecosystem, in which they added food coloring to determine the impacts of chemicals and acid rain. Youth then interpreted and discussed these findings, but did not connect the discussion to the water samples youth collected and tested earlier. This activity presented an opportunity for deeper engagement, in which youth could interpret and communicate findings related to the state of the water in their ecosystem, but, instead, it was potentially limiting in terms of youth's engagement in work with data.

A theme related to the challenge of linking activities concerned what the programs focused on. For example, the mathematics-focused programs, such as the *Adventures in Mathematics* program, the youth activity leaders recognizing that youth had difficulty solving equations, used duct tape and a "hippity hoppity", building on an earlier activity in which youth considered what constituted a rate, on how many "hops" it would take someone to move from one end of the line of duct tape to the other; the youth activity leader than asked youth to consider how far they could move in one hop and to consider how they could find out many hops it would take, using a mathematical equation. In this activity, youth were supported to approach mathematics problem-solving in creative ways. However, apart from data modeling, other aspects of work with data were rarely present, and most of the data that youth worked with was provided by the teacher or considered in the abstract. Programs focused on science or engineering, similarly, emphasized other aspects of work with data: The science-focused programs (*Island Explorers*, *The Ecosphere*, and *Marine Investigators*) all emphasized collecting and generating data, but data, particularly the data collected or generated, was rarely modeled or interpreted. In the engineering-focused programs (*Uptown Architecture*, *Crazy Machines*, and *Dorchester House*, youth often collected data that resulted from their engineering designs, and communicated and interpreted their findings, but, did not generate data, and, accordingly, (and like the science-focused programs) did not model data as a regular part of their activities. This finding suggests that while work with data may have been common overall, different aspects of instructional support for work with data were emphasized to different degrees based on the focus of the program.

<!-- A final constraint Regarding emphasizing outcomes other than the capacity to work with data, the programs emphasized outcomes such as youth's confidence in their learning, planning skills, and ability to collaborate. These outcomes are complimentary to building youth's ability to work with data, but at the same time, they meant that over the approximately four weeks of the program, limited time was dedicated to work with data ... Related, on occasion, youth demonstrated a reluctance to engage in what they perceived as "school" activities. -->

### Limitations of the Study

##### Measurement issues

How instructional support for work with data was measured seems to have been an issue, given the qualitative coding ...

As a type of sensitivity analysis focused on alternate model specifications (different from the kind described earlier for quantifying how robust an inference is to potential sources of bias or confounding variables, e.g. Frank, 2003), the model 1, seven profile solution is also explored, but results for it are included in the appendix. This model is less restrictive but does not meet the assumption of independence; some scholars refer to it, as such, as a general or Guassian mixture model solution, instead of an LPA solution (Bauer, 2004). Because covariances are estimated, relationships between the variables not captured in their mean levels estimated for each profile are also estimated. This suggests that these models may be modeling different relations between the variables than those associated with model 1 and that they may fit the data better, but they are also more complex and so should be interpreted with consideration these added parameters.

### Recommendations for Future Research

##### Explore work with data in settings designed to support it

There are increasingly "data camps" ...

##### Measure student work with data as well as instructional support for work with data

Measuring what students do in addition to what teachers do is important ...

##### Explore changes in longer-term outcomes

Changes in longer-term outcomes, such as future plans and goals, are an important goal for summer STEM educators and other stakeholders in such programs ...

### Implications for Practice

##### Engage students in complete cycles of investigation

##### Support engagement in specific moments

Viewing engagement in work with data in terms of engagement can help us to build the knowledge base around key data analytic practices for learners. In STEM settings, being engaged predicts key learning-related outcomes (Sinatra et al., 2015). As a consequence, what learners are thinking, feeling, and doing while engaged in work with data, and how challenged or good at data doing any or all of the aspects of work with data they perceive themselves to be, may important predictors of key outcomes and learnersâ€™ preparation for future learning (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999), especially for learning in data-rich areas of studies and occupations, such as data science. Engaging in work with data may also prepare learners to think of, understand, and take action based on data in their day-to-day lives.
