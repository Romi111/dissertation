## Title and Abstract

**Engaging in Data Practices in Summer STEM Programs: A Person-in-Context Approach**

Data-rich activities provide an opportunity for science and mathematics learners to develop empowering capabilities. Aspects of work with data are recognized as core competencies in both science and mathematics curricular standards and have been the focus of research over the past three decades. While research on work with data has focused on cognitive outcomes and the development of specific practices at the student and classroom levels, little research has considered learners' experience--their perceptions of themselves, the activity, and of how engaged they are--of work with data and engaging in data science. 

The present study explores learners' engagement in data practices in the context of summer STEM programs. The data practices that are the focus of this study are selected on the basis of past research in science and mathematics education and data science education (Lehrer & Schauble, 2015; Hardinn, Hoerl, Horton, Nolan, Baumer . . . & Ward, 2015) research. They are 1) asking questions, 2) observing phenomena, 3) constructing measures and generating data, 4) data modeling, and 5) interpreting findings. Because of the need to study learners' engagement in specific data practices, a person-in-context approach is used. Data from measures of learners' engagement is collected through an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) that involves asking learners at random intervals to answer short questions about their experience and are analyzed with a person-oriented approach to discover profiles of learners' engagement. The following research questions guide the study:

The four research questions are as follows:

1. What profiles of engagement and its conditions (PECs) emerge from the participants’ responses?
2. How does work with data relate to each PEC?
3. Do the relationships between work with data and the PECs vary depending on students’ pre-program interest in STEM? 
4. What are the common characteristics of potentially adaptive PECs beyond the presence of the aspects of work with data and other activities or the characteristics of learners?

These questions are explored in the context of nine summer STEM programs that took place over four week in one of two large cities in the Northeastern United States. 203 learners reported 2,970 responses via short ESM surveys of their perceptions of themselves (their competence) and of the activity (its challenge) and of how engaged they are. Programs were video-recorded, and segments of video associated with ESM responses were qualitatively coded for each of the data practices. Relations of learners engagement to the data practices were analyzed using multi-level models. Finally, activities were coded qualitatively to identify characteristics of particularly engaging activities.

Aspects of work with data were fairly common overall, though modeling data was less common than other data practices. Relations of specific practices show that generating data is associated with particularly adaptive profiles (characterized by high levels of engagement and learners' positive perceptions of themselves and the activity), potentially because this step makes the work with data concrete to learners. This study provides an understanding of learners' experience of work with data and how work with data differs from other activities in summer STEM programs. Findings have implications for supporting work with data in informal and formal learning environments and for how researchers can use a person-in-context approach to study engaging in data science in a way that is sensitive to moment-to-moment changes in learners' experience.
