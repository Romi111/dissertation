# Introduction {#intro-placemarker}

Socializing, working, and even teaching and learning are increasingly impacted by data. These sources of data--either quantitative *or* qualitative--are created by us, for us, and about us. Despite the impacts of data, present opportunities for learners themselves to work with data in educational settings are limited. 

Work with data includes broad processes of collecting, creating, modeling data, and even asking questions that can be answered with data. This work, then, is more than just crunching numbers. It is also more than interpreting a figure created by someone else. Rather, work with data is about making sense of phenomena in the world--or solving problems in the world. This focus on phenomena is particularly relevant to those designing and enacting learning opportunities focused on work with data (Lee & Wilkerson, 2018; Singer, Hilton, & Schweingruber, 2006; Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999). 

Despite not being very widespread, aspects of work with data cut across STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) domains: Aspects of work with data are recognized as core competencies across recent curricular documents. They are found, for example, in the *Next Generation Science Standards*  (NGSS Lead States, 2013) and the *Common Core State Standards* (in mathematics; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010). Both of these standards highlight the role of authentic work with data.

Past research on work with data has largely been set in mathematics contexts and has focused on mathematical practices, like generating measures of phenomena and creating data models (English, 2012; Lehrer & Romberg, 1996; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008). There has been some research about work with data in science settings (Lee & Wilkerson, in press; National Research Council, 2012), though this work varies greatly concerning the nature of work with data (McNeill & Berland, 2017). Findings from this past research broadly suggest that engaging in work with data is powerful in terms of learning both about and how to do mathematics and science. Lehrer and Schauble (2015), summarizing past research on the use of mathematical practices in science contexts, note that work with data “has an exceptionally high payoff in terms of students’ scientific reasoning” (Lehrer & Schauble, 2015, p. 696).

To date, past research shows that using a framework from contemporary engagement theory to characterize students’ experiences has been informative both in research and to practicing educators. Knowing more about how youth engage in work with data is valuable as engagement is a meaningful outcome for STEM learners in its own right (Sinatra, Heddy, & Lombardi, 2015). It may also be an antecedent of changes in other outcomes, such as their well-being, achievement, and pursuit of an area of study or career (Wang, Chow, Hofkens, & Salmela-Aro, 2015; Wang & Eccles, 2012). However, research has not examined engagement in work with data. Because engaging in work with data seems to be so potentially beneficial to learners, better understanding the nature of work with data and learners' engagement in such practices is needed. 

The purpose of this study, then, is to examine youth engagement in a variety of learning activities that involve work with data. Engagement is explored in the context of outside-of-school STEM enrichment programs carried out during the summer and work with data is considered through the lens of specific aspects identified from past research, such as asking questions and generating and modeling data. Knowing more about how youth engage can also provide a foundation for subsequent work to explore how particular curricula and engaging experiences for youth spark their interest in work with data, including hobbies and occupations related to data science, but also in STEM domains in general.
