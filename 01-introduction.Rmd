# Introduction {#intro-placemarker}

Changes in how we plan our day-to-day lives, communicate, and learn are increasingly impacted by data. These sources of data are created by us, for us, and about us, although at present opportunities for learners to analyze data in educational settings remain limited. Data analysis includes processes of collecting, creating, modeling data, and asking questions that may be answered with data and making sense of findings. Analyzing data in educational settings, then, is more than just crunching numbers or interpreting a figure created by someone else, but rather is about making sense of phenomena and problem solving (Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999). Data analysis and its processes cut across STEM domains and are recognized as core competencies in both the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010; NGSS Lead States, 2013). Scholars have pointed out the benefits of analyzing data for learners as young as two years old (Gopnik, & Sobel, 2000). 

In supporting teachers and learners’ data analysis efforts, some scholars have focused on the process of key data analytic practices, particularly the practices of generating measures of phenomena and creating data models—as an organizing activity in science and mathematics content areas (English, 2012; Lehrer & Romberg, 1996; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008). Findings from this area of research suggest that engaging in these practices “has an exceptionally high payoff in terms of students’ scientific reasoning” (Lehrer & Schauble, 2015, p. 696) and can highlight the utility of mathematics for students’ lives (Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008).

While scholars have looked at cognitive outcomes and learners’ capability to participate in specific, key aspects of data analysis as well as strategies to address key challenges of doing so, they have not yet examined key data analytic practices in terms of engagement theory. In this study, I use contemporary engagement theory as a framework to understand learners’ experience of engaging in their work with data. In this framework, engagement is considered to multi-dimensional and dynamic, or changing over time (Fredricks & McColskey, 2012). Scholars commonly consider engagement in terms of three dimensions: cognitive (i.e., use of meta-cognitive learning strategies), behavioral (hard work on a task), and affective dimensions (enjoyment; Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004; Sinatra, Heddy, & Lombardi, 2015; Skinner & Pitzer, 2012).

In recognition of its dynamic nature, some engagement scholars have usefully drawn upon flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, 1997) to identify how learners’ perceived competence and challenge act as key conditions of engagement (Shernoff, Kelly, Tonks, Anderson, Cavanagh, Sinha, & Abdi, 2016), aligning with situated views of learning (Sfard, 1998) and motivation (Nolen, Horn, & Ward, 2015). 

The purpose of this study, then, is to understand learners’ experience of engagement in work with data and the conditions that support it. Engagement is understood in terms of cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions, and the conditions that support engagement are understood in terms of two subjective components that past research and theory suggest influence engagement: perceived challenge and perceived competence, as well as instructional support for engaging in aspects of work with data. Engagement in work with data is explored in the context of outside-of-school STEM enrichment programs carried out during the summer. 

In recognition of the challenge of studying engagement in learning environments where factors related to activities, learners, and each of the nine programs all interact at the same time, this study uses a methodological approach suited to studying engagement as a dynamic, multi-faceted experience. Specifically, this study employs the Experience Sampling Method (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007) where learners answer short questions about their experience when signaled. This approach is both sensitive to changes in engagement over time, as well as between learners and allows us to understand engagement and how factors impact it in more nuanced and complex ways (Turner & Meyer, 2000).
