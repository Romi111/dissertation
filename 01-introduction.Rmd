# Introduction {#intro-placemarker}

Changes in how we plan our day-to-day lives, communicate, and learn are increasingly impacted by data. These sources of data--quantitative and qualitative--are created by us, for us, and about us, although at present opportunities for learners to analyze data in educational settings remain limited. Work with data more broadly includes processes of collecting, creating, modeling data, and asking questions that may be answered with data and making sense of findings. 

Work with data, then, is more than just crunching numbers or interpreting a figure created by someone else, but rather is about making sense of phenomena and problem solving, a point particularly relevant to educational contexts (Lee & Wilkerson, 2018; Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999). Aspects of work with data cut across STEM domains and are recognized as core competencies in both the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards in mathematics (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010; NGSS Lead States, 2013). Scholars have pointed out the benefits of working with data for learners as young as two years old (Gopnik, & Sobel, 2000). 

In supporting teachers and learners’ data analysis efforts, scholars have examined a variety of practices. In particular, past research has focused on mathematical activities like generating measures of phenomena and creating data models (English, 2012; Lehrer & Romberg, 1996; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008). Findings from this area of research suggest that engaging in these practices “has an exceptionally high payoff in terms of students’ scientific reasoning” (Lehrer & Schauble, 2015, p. 696) and can highlight the utility of mathematics for students’ lives (Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008).

Because engaging in data-related practices seems to be so potentially beneficial to learners, we need to better understand the nature of learners' engagement in learning activities that involve various aspects of work with data. To date, past research shows that using an engagement framework to characterize students’ learning activities is highly informative. One’s engagement in learning tasks is a key outcome in its own right and may be an antecedent of changes in other outcomes, such as their well-being, achievement and pursuit of an area of study or career (Sinatra, Heddy, & Lombardi, 2015; Wang, Chow, Hofkens, & Salmela-Aro, 2015; Wang & Eccles, 2012). However, research has not examined engagement in these particular types of activities in particular.

In this framework, engagement is considered to multi-dimensional and dynamic, or changing over time (Fredricks & McColskey, 2012). Scholars commonly consider engagement in terms of three dimensions: cognitive (i.e., use of meta-cognitive learning strategies), behavioral (hard work on a task), and affective dimensions (enjoyment; Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004; Sinatra, et al., 2015; Skinner & Pitzer, 2012). In recognition of its dynamic nature, some engagement scholars have drawn upon flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, 1997) to identify not only dimensions of engagement, but also other, subjective, characteristics that effect engagement. This past research, drawn upon in the present study, has considered two of learners’ subjective considerations, their perceived competence and challenge, act as key conditions of engagement (Shernoff, Kelly, Tonks, Anderson, Cavanagh, Sinha, & Abdi, 2016). The present study will examine engagement using these multiple dimensions.

The purpose of this study, then, is to examine youth engagement in a variety of learning activities that involve work with data. Engagement in work with data is explored in the context of outside-of-school STEM enrichment programs carried out during the summer and work with data is considered in terms of specific aspects identified from past research, such as asking questions and generating and modeling data.
