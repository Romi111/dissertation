# Introduction {#intro-placemarker}

Changes in how we plan our day-to-day lives, communicate, and learn are increasingly impacted by data. These sources of data--quantitative and qualitative--are created by us, for us, and about us, although at present opportunities for learners to analyze data in educational settings remain limited. Work with data more broadly includes processes of collecting, creating, modeling data, and asking questions that may be answered with data and making sense of findings. 

Work with data, then, is more than just crunching numbers or interpreting a figure created by someone else, but rather is about making sense of phenomena and problem solving, a point particularly relevant to work with data in educational contexts (Lee & Wilkerson, 2018; Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999). Aspects of work with data cut across STEM domains and are recognized as core competencies in both the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010; NGSS Lead States, 2013). Scholars have pointed out the benefits of analyzing data for learners as young as two years old (Gopnik, & Sobel, 2000). 

In supporting teachers and learners’ data analysis efforts, some scholars have focused on key data analytic processes, particularly those related to generating measures of phenomena and creating data models, using these as anchoring practices for other aspects of work with data, like posing questions (English, 2012; Lehrer & Romberg, 1996; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008). Findings from this area of research suggest that engaging in these practices “has an exceptionally high payoff in terms of students’ scientific reasoning” (Lehrer & Schauble, 2015, p. 696) and can highlight the utility of mathematics for students’ lives (Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008).

Learners' experiences, considered from the perspective of engagement theory, consist not only of cognitive processes, but also behavioral and even affective dimensions, too (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004; Skinner & Pitzer, 2012). When learners' experiences are considered in terms of their engagement, we can hypothesize that learners who are engaged in high-quality activities related to work with data will be more or less cognitively, behaviorally, and affectively engaged. This engagement is a key outcome in its own right and may be an antecedent of changes in other outcomes, such as students' intention to pursue an area of study or career in a STEM domain. 

While scholars have looked at cognitive outcomes and learners’ capability to participate in specific, learners' experiences of working with data has not been the focus of past research. Thus, the present study sets out to understand to how learners' experiences are impacted by work with data. In this study, I use contemporary engagement theory as a framework to understand learners’ experience. In this framework, engagement is considered to multi-dimensional and dynamic, or changing over time (Fredricks & McColskey, 2012). Scholars commonly consider engagement in terms of three dimensions: cognitive (i.e., use of meta-cognitive learning strategies), behavioral (hard work on a task), and affective dimensions (enjoyment; Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004; Sinatra, Heddy, & Lombardi, 2015; Skinner & Pitzer, 2012). In recognition of its dynamic nature, some engagement scholars have usefully drawn upon flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, 1997) to identify not only dimensions of engagement, but also other, subjective, characteristics that effect engagement. This past research, drawn upon in the present study, has considered how learners’ perceived competence and challenge act as key conditions of engagement (Shernoff, Kelly, Tonks, Anderson, Cavanagh, Sinha, & Abdi, 2016), aligning with situated views of learning (Sfard, 1998) and motivation (Nolen, Horn, & Ward, 2015). 

The purpose of this study, then, is to understand learners’ experience of engaging in work with data.. Engagement is understood in terms of cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions, and the conditions that support engagement are understood in terms of two subjective components that past research and theory suggest influence engagement: perceived challenge and perceived competence. Work with data is considered in terms of specific aspects, such as asking questions and generating and modeling data, identified from past research. Engagement in work with data is explored in the context of outside-of-school STEM enrichment programs carried out during the summer.
