The framework for this study is informed by work on STEM-related learning practices, or activities, student engagement, and analytic approaches to modeling multidimensional constructs. In this review of literature, I define work with data as a key practice across STEM domains. I also describe and justify a multi-dimensional framework for understanding engagement, and then review an approach to analyzing data that is ideal for capturing this multidimensionality. 

## Defining Work with Data

Some scholars have focused on a few key pieces of data analysis, connected through the use of “data to solve real problems and to answer authentic questions” (Hancock et al., 1992, p. 337). This focus on solving real problems or answering authentic questions--rather than being taught and learned as isolated skills--is an essential part of work with data having the most educational benefits to learners (National Research Council, 2012; see Lehrer and Schauble [2012] Windschitl, Thompson, & Braaten [2018] for excellent, practice, in-depth examples of work with data being used as part of instructional approaches). This approach has primarily been taken up by mathematics educators and is reflected in statistics curriculum documents (Franklin et al., 2007). In science settings, where answering questions about phenomena serve as the focus of activities, it shares features of the process of engaging in scientific and engineering practices, but has been less often studied.

While work with data has been conceived in different ways, some core components have emerged. See Lee and Wikerson's (in press) forthcoming summary report for the National Academy of Sciences and Wild and Pfannkuch (1999), Franklin et al. (2007), and Lehrer and Schauble (2004) for some specific examples from different domains. The core components, when synthesized, are better for understanding work with data across STEM content areas--as in the present study--than the components from specific examples, which were developed for use in only one domain. The aspects of work with data that have been articulated in prior studies are distilled into five key aspects (Figure 1) for use in this study. They are:

* *Asking questions*: Generating questions that can be answered with empirical evidence
* *Making observations*: Watching phenomena and noticing what is happening with respect to the phenomena or problem being investigated
* *Generating data*: The process of figuring out how or why to inscribe an observation as data about a phenomena, as well as generating coding frames or tools for measuring
* *Data modeling*: Activities involving use of simple statistics, such as the mean and variance, as well as more complicated models, such as linear models and extensions of the linear model
* *Interpreting and communicating findings*: Activities related to identifying a driving question regarding the phenomena that the question is about

```

These five synthesized practices are a part of a cycle because not only does each part follow that before it, but also because the overall process is iterative: interpreting findings commonly leads to new questions and subsequent engagement in work with data. Also, scholars have pointed out some key features of how work with data is carried out that impact their effectiveness as a pedagogical approach. These key features include an emphasis on making sense of real-world phenomena and iterative cycles of engaging in work with data and collaboration and dialogue, through which ideas and intermediate findings are critiqued and subject to critique, and revised over time (McNeill & Berland, 2017; Lee & Wilkerson, in press). 

## The role of working with data in STEM learning environments

Working with data can serve as an organizing set of practices for engaging in inquiry in STEM learning settings (Lehrer & Schauble, 2015). Data are both encountered and generated by learners, and so opportunities for learners to work with data provide many opportunities to leverage their curiosity because processes of inquiry can be grounded in phenomena that learners themselves can see and manipulate or phenomena that learners are interested in. Also important, becoming proficient in work with data can provide learners with an in-demand capability in society, owing to the number of occupations, from education to entrepreneurship, that demand or involve taking action based on data (Wilkerson & Fenwick, 2017). Furthermore, becoming proficient in work with data can be personally empowering because of the parts of our lives--from paying energy bills to interpreting news articles--that use data.

Recent educational reform efforts emphasize work with data (i.e., the scientific and engineering practices in the NGSS and the standards for mathematical practice in the Common Core State Standards). However, work with data is uncommon in many classroom settings (even classrooms emphasizing recent science education reform effrts; McNeill & Berland, 2017; Miller, Manz, Russ, Stroupe, & Berland, in press), and so learning environments suited to engaging in work with data, but not explicitly designed to support it, may be valuable to study because they may serve as incubators of these rare and challenging learning activities.

Outside-of-school programs are a potentially valuable setting to explore engagement in work with data because of the combined pedagogical and technical expertise of their staff and the activities learners do during their participation in them. Staff for these programs includes educators and scientists, engineers, and others with the technical experience. Additionally, the programs were designed to involve learners in the types of real-world practices experienced by experts in STEM disciplines. Attendance in such programs is associated with many benefits to learners (Green, Lee, Constance, & Hynes, 2013; see Lauer, Akiba, Wilkerson, Apthorp, Snow, & Martin-Glenn, 2006, for a comprehensive review). These programs are also selected because little research has examined how data are part of the experiences of youth in out-of-school-time programs, despite its place as one of a few core practices in STEM. While these reasons to study work with data focus on outside-of-school programs, they are also germane and applicable to more formal learning environments, such as classrooms, in which teachers want to design opportunities for their learners to work with data. 

## What We Know (And Do Not Know) About How Youth Work with Data

Scholars have researched cognitive capabilities as outcomes related to work with data. Much of this laboratory-based research has focused on how children develop the capability to inductively reason from observations (Gelman & Markman, 1987). Other research has focused on the development of causal, or mechanistic, reasoning, among young children (Gopnik et al., 2001; Gopnik & Sobel, 2000), often from a Piagetian, individual-development focused tradition (i.e., Piaget & Inhelder, 1969). A key outcome of engaging in work with data has to do with how learners account for variability (Lehrer, Kim, & Schauble, 2007; Petrosino, Lehrer, & Schauble, 2003; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, & Gupta, 2008; Lee, Angotti, & Tarr, 2010), arguably the main goal of engaging in work with data (Konold & Pollatsek, 2002). From this research, we know that learners can develop the capacity to reason about variability (and covariability).

Past research has also shown that there are strategies that can support work with data. These include the design of technological tools and the development of curricula. From this research, we know about specific strategies and learning progressions for learners to develop this capability, such as the role of measurement in exposing learners in a direct way to sources of variability (Petrosino et al., 2003), role of simulation to learn about sampling distributions (Stohl & Tarr, 2002), and use of relevant phenomena, such as manufacturing processes, such as the size of metallic bolts, which can help learners to focus on “tracking a process by looking at its output” (Konold & Pollatsek, 2002, p. 282). 

Finally, past research has shown that different aspects of work with data pose unique opportunities and challenges. Asking empirical questions requires experience and ample time to ask a question that is both able to be answered with data and which is sustaining and worth investigating (Bielik, 2016; Hasson & Yarden, 2012). Making observations and generating data, such as of the height of the school’s flagpole, requires negotiation not only of what to measure, but how and how many times to measure it (Lehrer, Kim, & Schauble, 2007). Regarding modeling, not only teaching students about models, such as that of the mean, but also asking them to create them, are valuable and practical (Lehrer & Schauble, 2004; Lehrer, Kim, & Jones, 2011), but also time-intensive. Interpreting findings, especially in light of variability through models, and communicating answers to questions, means not only identifying error but understanding its sources, and can be supported through exploring models that deliberately represent the data poorly, but can be instructive for probing the benefits and weaknesses of models (Lee & Hollebrands, 2008; Lehrer, Kim, & Schauble, 2007). 

Despite this past research, how learners and youth participate in different aspects of work with data in terms of engagement theory has not been examined. Consider the practice of modeling data, commonly described as a—-or *the*-—key part of many applied data analyses (Konold, Finzer, & Kreetong, 2017). When modeling data, learners may use data they generated and structured in a data set on their own, or may model already-processed, or use already-plotted, data (McNeill & Berland, 2017). How challenging do students perceive the different enactments of these activities to be and how do learners perceive their competence regarding them? Importantly, how hard are learners working? How much do they feel they are learning? Knowing more about these beliefs, characteristics, and processes could help us to develop informed recommendations for teachers and designers intending to bring about opportunities for learners to engage in work with data in a better-supported way that is sustained over time.

## Engagement in General and in STEM Domains

The nature of engagement is discussed in terms of general features that have been identified across content area domains, conditions that support engagement, and differences between engagement in general and in STEM settings. This is followed by a discussion of two key features of engagement: its dynamic, or context-dependent, characteristics and its multidimensional nature. Finally, methods for capturing these two features empirically through the Experience Sampling Method, or ESM--and how this (multidimensional) data can be analyzed--are described.

Engagement is defined in this study as active involvement, or investment, in activities (Blumenfeld et al., 2004). Explaining how learners are involved in activities and tasks is especially important if we want to know about what aspects of work with data are most engaging (and in what ways), and therefore can serve as exemplary for others advancing work with data as well as those calling for greater support for engagement. Apart from being focused on involvement, engagement is often thought of as a meta-construct, that is, one that is made up of other constructs (Skinner & Pitzer, 2012; Skinner, Kindermann, & Furrer, 2009). By defining engagement as a meta-construct, scholars characterize it in terms of cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions that are distinct yet interrelated (Fredricks, 2016). 

We know from past research that the cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of engagement can be distinguished (Wang & Eccles, 2012; Wang & Holcombe, 2012) and that while there are long-standing concerns about the conceptual breadth of engagement (Fredricks et al., 2016), careful justification and thoughtful use of multidimensional engagement constructs and measures is warranted. Engagement is also considered to be changing in response to individual, situation or moment contextual factors, Skinner and Pitzer's (2012) model of motivational dynamics, highlighting the community, school, classroom, and even learning activity, shows the context-dependent nature of engagement on the basis of the impacts of these factors on learners' engagement.

Engagement in STEM settings shares characteristics with engagement across disciplines, yet there are some distinct aspects of it (Greene, 2015). While one type of engagement—behavioral—is associated with achievement-related outcomes, many STEM practices call for engagement in service of other outcomes, especially around epistemic and agency-related dimensions (Sinatra et al., 2015,). For example, many scholars have defined scientific and engineering practices as cognitive practices, which involve applying *epistemic considerations* around sources of evidence and the nature of explanatory processes (see Berland et al. 2016, Stroupe, 2014; Miller et al., in press). 

The emphasis on developing new knowledge and capabilities through engaging in STEM practices must be reflected in how the cognitive dimension of engagement is measured. Because of the importance of constructing knowledge to engagement in STEM practices, then, cognitive engagement is defined for this study in terms of learning something new or getting better at something. While sometimes defined in terms of extra-curricular involvement or following directions, behavioral engagement is defined in this study as working hard at and concentrating on learning-related activities (Fredricks et al., 2004; Singh, Granville, & Dika, 2002). Finally, affective engagement is defined as affective responses to activities, such as being excited, angry, or relaxed (Pekrun & Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2012). 

## The conditions in which engagement may occur and the factors that impact engagement

Past research suggests learners or youths' characteristics, such as their interest in the domain of study, impact their cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement (Shernoff et al., 2003; Shernoff et al., 2016; Shumow, Schmidt, & Zaleski, 2013). These are both moment-to-moment, context-dependent conditions in which engagement may occur, as well as factors at the level of individual differences (i.e., youths' more stable interest in STEM domains) that may impact engagement.

Focusing first on context-dependent conditions, Emergent Motivation Theory (EMT; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), provides a useful lens. From EMT, a key moment-to-moment condition for engagement is how difficult individuals perceive an activity to be, or its *perceived challenge*. Another key condition is how good at an activity individuals perceive themselves to be, or their *perceived competence*.Important in terms of the EMT, being challenged by and good at an activity are especially engaging experienced when together. Past research has supported this contention (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). As one empirical example, Shernoff et al. (2016) demonstrated that while challenge and skill with high levels of one but low levels on the other (i.e., high challenge and low skill) were not broadly associated with positive forms of engagement, their interaction was. These findings suggest that learners’ perceptions of the challenge of the activity, and their perceptions of how skillful they are, are important conditions that co-occur with learners' engagement. Conceptualizing perceptions of challenge and competence as conditions, rather than factors that influence engagement, is in recognition of their co-occurrence within individuals, in that youth experience engagement and their perceptions of the activity (perceived challenge) and of themselves (perceive competence) together and at the same time. 

A factor that can support engagement concerns teacher support for specific practices (Strati, Schmidt, & Maier, 2017). Particularly concerning work with data, which is demanding not only for learners but also teachers, sustained support from teachers is an essential component of learners being able to work with data (Lehrer & Schauble, 2015; Wilkerson, Andrews, Shaban, Laina, & Gravel, 2016). Consequently, this study considers work with data through the use of a coding frame that characterizes the extent to which teachers are supporting specific STEM practices in their instruction, including aspects of work with data.

Other factors that impact youths' engagement are individual differences. In recognition of differences among learners in their tendency to engage in different (higher or lower) ways in specific activities based in part on individual differences (Hidi & Renninger, 2006), learners’ interest in STEM before the start of the programs is also considered as a factor that can impact engagement. Finally, gender and the racial and ethnic group of students is added, as past research has indicated these as factors that influence engagement in STEM (Bystydzienski, Eisenhart, & Bruning; Shernoff & Schmidt, 2008). 

## Challenges of Studying Engagement as a Contextually-Dependent and Multidimensional Construct

Because of the way engagement has been thought of as having context-dependent characteristics and being multi-dimensional, it is challenging to use (when conceptualized in such a way) in empirical studies. One methodological approach that has benefits in terms of both the context-dependent and multidimensional nature of engagement is the ESM. A number of scholars have explored or extolled benefits to its use in their recent work (e.g., Strati et al., 2017; Turner & Meyer, 2000; Sinatra et al., 2015). 

ESM involves asking—usually using a digital tool and occasionally a diary—to ask participants short questions about their experiences. ESM is particularly well-suited to understanding the context-dependent nature of engagement because students answered brief surveys about their experience when they were signaled, minimally interrupting them from the activity they are engaged in and also seeking to collect measures about learners’ experience when signaled (Hektner, et al., 2007). Specifically, this study employs the Experience Sampling Method (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007) where learners answer short questions about their experience when signaled. This approach is both sensitive to changes in engagement over time, as well as between learners and allows us to understand engagement and how factors impact it in more nuanced and complex ways (Turner & Meyer, 2000).Though time-consuming to carry out, ESM can be a powerful measure that leverages the benefits of both observational and self-report measures, allowing for some ecological validity and the use of closed-form questionnaires amenable to quantitative analysis (Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1987). Despite the logistic challenge of carrying out ESM in large studies, some scholars have referred to it as the “gold standard” for understanding individual’s subjective experience (Schwarz, Kahneman, & Xu, 2009).

Research has shown us how the use of ESM can lead to distinct research contributions and also suggests how ESM can be put to use for the purpose of the present study. For example, Shernoff, Csikszentmihalyi, Schneider, and Shernoff (2003) examined engagement through the use of measures aligned with flow theory, namely, using measures of concentration, interest, and enjoyment (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). In a study using the same measures of engagement (Shernoff et al. (2016) used an observational measure of challenge and control (or environmental complexity) and found that it significantly predicted engagement, as well as self-esteem, intrinsic motivation, and academic intensity. Schneider et al. (2016) and Linnansaari et al. (2015) examined features of optimal learning moments or moments in which students report high levels of interest, skill, and challenge, as well as their antecedents and consequences. Similar to ESM in that through its use engagement can be studied in a more context-sensitive, still other scholars have used daily diary studies to examine engagement as a function of autonomy-supportive classroom practices (Patall, Vasquez, Steingut, Trimble, & Pituch, 2015; Patall, Steingut, Vasquez, Trimble, & Freeman, 2017). This past research that used ESM (or daily diary studies) to study engagement has shown that ESM can be used to understand fine-grained differences in learning activities, such as the aspects of work with data that are the focus of this study.

Other research shows us that there are newer approaches to analyzing ESM data that can contribute insights into the context-dependent nature of engagement in a more fine-grained way. For example, Strati et al. (2017) explored the relations between engagement to measures of teacher support, finding associations between instrumental support and engagement and powerfully demonstrating the capacity of ESM to understand some of the context-dependent nature of engagement. Similarly, Poysa et al. (2017) used a similar data analytic approach as Strati et al. (2017), that is, use of crossed effects models for variation within both students and time points, both within and between days. These studies establish the value of the use of ESM to understand the context-dependent nature of engagement and that such an approach may be able to be used to understand engaging in work with data. Additionally, these recent studies (particularly the study by Strati and colleagues) show that how effects at different levels are treated, namely, how variability at these levels is accounted for through random effects as part of mixed effects models, is a key practical consideration for the analysis of ESM data.

One powerful and increasingly widely used way to examine context-dependent constructs, such as engagement holistically is the use of *profiles*, or groups of variables that are measured. This profile approach is especially important given the multidimensional nature of engagement. Profiles are commonly used as part of what are described as person-oriented approaches, those used to consider the way in which psychological constructs are experienced together and at once in the experiences of learners. In the context of the present study, this approach can help to identify naturally occurring profiles of engagement, or engagement as reported by youth via ESM during particular moments. Note that in the present study, ESM involves asking youth about to report on their experience at the time they were signaled (rather than, for example, before or after the program, which traditional surveys are well-suited for).

In this study, profiles seek to understand how students experience work with data (through the lens of engagement and its in-the-moment conditions) in a more holistic way. There are some recent studies taking a profile approach to the study of engagement (i.e., Salmela-Aro, Moeller, Schneider, Spicer, & Lavonen, 2016a; Salmela-Aro, Muotka, Alho, Hakkarainen, & Lonka, 2016b; Van Rooij, Jansen, & van de Grift, 2017; Schmidt, Rosenberg, & Beymer, 2018), though none have done so to study youths' engagement in work with data. 

The profile approach has an important implication for how we analyze data collected from ESM about youths' engagement, in particular when we consider how to understand engagement as a multi-dimensional construct, and one with momentary, or instructional episode-specific, conditions (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). We know from past research that engagement can be explained in terms of different patterns among its individual components (Bergman & Magnusson, 1997), in the present case its cognitive, behavioral, and affective components. Because learners’ engagement includes cognitive, behavioral, and affective aspects experienced together at the same time, it can be experienced as a combined effect that is categorically distinct from the effects of the individual dimensions of engagement. This combined effect can be considered as profiles of engagement. 

Past studies have considered profiles of cognitive, behavioral, and affective aspects of engagement. For example, to account for the context-dependent nature of engagement, some past studies have used other measures to predict engagement, such as use of in-the-moment resources and demands (Salmela-Aro et al., 2016b) or, in the case of the study reviewed in the previous section, use of instructional activities and choice (Schmidt et al., 2018). Different from this past research, another potential way to account for the context-dependent nature of engagement is to consider both engagement and its conditions at once. Since a profile approach emphasizes the context-dependent nature of development and the impact of not only external but also intra-individual factors. As in the present study, youths' perceptions of challenge and competence, also collected via ESM, are used along with the measures of engagement to construct profiles of engagement. Thus, the profiles of engagement include youths' responses to five ESM items for their cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and their perceptions of how challenging the activity they were doing is and of how competent at the activity they are.

## Need for the Present Study

While many scholars have argued that work with data can be understood in terms of the capabilities learners develop and the outcome learners achieve, there is a need to better understand learners’ (and youths') experiences working with data. The present study does this through the use of contemporary engagement theory and innovative methodological and analytic approaches. Doing this can help us to understand work with data in terms of learner's experience, which we know from past research impacts what and how students learn (Sinatra et al., 2015). Knowing more about students’ engagement can help us to design activities and interventions focused around work with data that are more engaging and which provide more support to learners in terms of their perceptions of challenge and their own competence. In addition to this general need to study engagement in work with data through the lens of engagement, no research that I am aware of has examined work with data or data analysis more generally in the context of outside-of-school programs. These settings are potentially rich with opportunities for highly engaged youth to analyze authentic data sources. Finally, little research has examined how data is part of the experiences of youth in out-of-school-time programs, despite its place as one of a few core practices in STEM.

## Conceptual Framework and Research Questions

To summarize, the present study is about how learning activities involving various aspects of work with data can be understood in terms of engagement. Its context is out-of-school-time STEM enrichment programs designed to meet guidelines for best practices. The conceptual framework in the present study is presented in Figure 2 and is laid out in the remainder of this section. 
 
```{r, eval = T, fig.cap = "A conceptual framework for this study with research questions labeled"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure2.png")
``` 

There are five aspects of work with data synthesized from past research (i.e., Hancock et al., 1992; Lehrer & Romberg, 1996; Wild & Pfannkuch, 1999):

1. Asking questions or identifying problems
1. Making observations
1. Generating data
1. Data modeling
1. Interpreting and communicating findings

In Figure 2, engagement in work with data is associated with different profiles of engagement and its conditions, referred to as profiles of engagement in the remainder of this manuscript. The theoretical framework for the profile approach suggests that engagement is a multi-dimensional construct consisting of cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of engagement and perceptions of challenge and competence. In addition, a pre-program measure of learners’ individual interest in STEM is hypothesized to be associated with the profiles and the relations of work with data and the profiles. The ESM responses that make up the profiles are associated with students, instructional episodes (or the moments--or segments--for which youth are asked to respond to the ESM signal), and program effects that must be accounted for (Strati et al., 2017). These three random effects represent systematic variation at these different "levels", in that the modeling approach can account for how much variability in the dependent variable is explained exclusively by the presence of these (student, instructional episide, and program) levels, or groups, that are present given the data collection method.

As depicted in the Figure 2, the four research questions are formalized as follows:

1. What is the frequency and nature of opportunities for youth to engage in each of the five aspects of work with data in summer STEM programs?
2. What profiles of engagement emerge from data collected via ESM in the programs?
3. How do the five aspects of work with data relate to profiles of engagement?
4. How do youth characteristics relate to profiles of engagement?
