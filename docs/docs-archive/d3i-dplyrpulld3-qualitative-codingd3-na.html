To code the data, three research assistants were trained for approximately eight hours over four meetings. Then, each research assistant coded all of the segments associated with one of the videos. After the coding was complete, the three research assistants and I met to discuss how well the coding frame and potential sources of disagreement. Then, two coders coded every segment that was coded for at least one of the aspects of instructional support for work with data. This coding took around 75 hours of coding by the research assistants. After each program, the coders met to discuss potential issues that emerged throughout the coding, and to clarify how they applied the coding frame. As this was open-ended coding with the aim to provide greater detail and context for the findings associated with research questions #2 and #3, establishing reliability among the coders was not carried out. The coders sought to document a) the characteristics of instructional support for work with data and b) other aspects of the instructional context that impacts student work with data.

Note that while the first of the two aspects focuses on the support provided by the instructor, the second aspect focuses on how students engage in work with data in ways that on occasion diverge (in ways productive and not productive in terms of student work with data) from what would be expected on the basis of the instructional support. This coding resulted in around three to four sentence notes associated with each segment from each of two raters. Then, I reviewed these notes with the aim to identify themes based on enriching and better understanding the findings for research questions #2-#4 and, beyond these findings, to better understand the nature of work with data in summer STEM programs.

### Affordances and constraints of summer STEM programs for work with data

Summer STEM program have affordances and constraints work with data. Thus, different from the previous theme that was focused on a study-related issue, this theme concerns differences in the nature of the instruction and learning opportunities that learners experienced as part of their time in the summer STME programs.

#### Affordances

Affordances included the community setting and the relevance of the program to youth&#39;s lives.

For example, in the *Marine Investigators*, youth participated in activities designed to help them understand water quality in their ecosystem. Youth collected trash from sites around their community (in different &quot;districts&quot;) and then brought the trash and recyclable plastic back to the classroom. Then, the youth activity leaders asked students to figure out how much plastic enters local waterways. As a part of this activity, youth activity leaders asked students not only to determine the quantity of trash that entered the waterways, but asked students about *why* they used math in particular ways (i.e., adding the quantity of trash collected and then extrapolating from this quantity to the amount from across the entire city over the course of the year). This appeared to be a powerful activity, one that was coded as involving all five aspects of work with data according to the measures for instructional support for work with data; this type of activity seemed to suggest that instructional support for work with data may impact youth&#39;s engagement.

Another affordance concerned the relevance of the program to youth&#39;s lives. For example, in the *Building Mania* program, youth are involved in engineering design (i.e., identifying a problem and designing a solution), particularly around the use of simple machines. In a day in the classroom setting, youth are creating, testing, and revising catapults. In the next day, youth visit an area University, and are led in a discussion by a physicist who works with particle colliders. In this example, the expertise of the physicist, who explicitly mentions the benefits of engaging in the engineering design process and the importance of combining engineering to addressing problems (such as mitigating the damage of earthquakes), seems to be highly relevant to what youth are doing in their class. In these two days of class, youth are engaged in different aspects of work with data as indicated by the codes for instructional support for work with data (collecting data on the efficacy of their designs in the classroom day, and asking questions in the subsequent day, particularly); these seem to suggest, like the example of work work with data from the *Marine Investigators* program, affordances of work with data for summer STEM programs.

#### Constraints

Constraints included the challenge of linking activities as a part of a complete cycle of investigation and an emphasis on different aspects of work with data as part of programming.

Youth activity leaders faced challenges linking activities as part of a complete cycle of investigation. For example, in the *Ecosphere* program, youth collected water samples in the field. They then brought these samples to the classroom and tested the water, involving students in both collecting and, to a degree, generating data (by noting the pH levels of the water). However, later in the day, youth created a small-scale model (with inclined trays of dirt, rocks, and plants) of an ecosystem, in which they added food coloring to determine the impacts of chemicals and acid rain. Youth then interpreted and discussed these findings, but did not connect the discussion to the water samples youth collected and tested earlier. This activity presented an opportunity for deeper engagement, in which youth could interpret and communicate findings related to the state of the water in their ecosystem, but, instead, it was potentially limiting in terms of youth&#39;s engagement in work with data.

A theme related to the challenge of linking activities concerned what the programs focused on. For example, the mathematics-focused programs, such as the *Adventures in Mathematics* program, the youth activity leaders recognizing that youth had difficulty solving equations, used duct tape and a &quot;hippity hoppity&quot;, building on an earlier activity in which youth considered what constituted a rate, on how many &quot;hops&quot; it would take someone to move from one end of the line of duct tape to the other; the youth activity leader than asked youth to consider how far they could move in one hop and to consider how they could find out many hops it would take, using a mathematical equation. In this activity, youth were supported to approach mathematics problem-solving in creative ways. However, apart from data modeling, other aspects of work with data were rarely present, and most of the data that youth worked with was provided by the teacher or considered in the abstract. Programs focused on science or engineering, similarly, emphasized other aspects of work with data: The science-focused programs (*Island Explorers*, *The Ecosphere*, and *Marine Investigators*) all emphasized collecting and generating data, but data, particularly the data collected or generated, was rarely modeled or interpreted. In the engineering-focused programs (*Uptown Architecture*, *Crazy Machines*, and *Dorchester House*, youth often collected data that resulted from their engineering designs, and communicated and interpreted their findings, but, did not generate data, and, accordingly, (and like the science-focused programs) did not model data as a regular part of their activities. This finding suggests that while work with data may have been common overall, different aspects of instructional support for work with data were emphasized to different degrees based on the focus of the program.

&lt;!-- A final constraint Regarding emphasizing outcomes other than the capacity to work with data, the programs emphasized outcomes such as youth&#39;s confidence in their learning, planning skills, and ability to collaborate. These outcomes are complimentary to building youth&#39;s ability to work with data, but at the same time, they meant that over the approximately four weeks of the program, limited time was dedicated to work with data ... Related, on occasion, youth demonstrated a reluctance to engage in what they perceived as &quot;school&quot; activities. --&gt;

### How instructional support for work with data was measured

This theme concerned how instructional support was measured and how this impacted the findings presented in research questions #2 and #3. As an example, in a video associated with a mathematics-focused activity in the Comunidad de Aprendizaje program, a youth activity leader is discussing with youth opportunities for them to market products that they developed to sell in their communities and highlighting the expense of creating the product, its sale price, and its potential process. In this example, observing data is coded, but this aspect of instructional support for work with data does not appear to be present. Considering the STEM-PQA code on which the code for making observations is based, this difference is possibly due to a distinction in what both codes are focused on. The STEM-PQA code is for *classifying or abstracting*, and its operationalization emphasizes staff supporting youth in linking concrete examples to principles, categories, or formulas. The conceptual definition of *making observations*, though, emphasizes watching and noticing what is happening with respect to the phenomena being investigated. In this case, the application of the STEM-PQA code was sensible, as the youth activity leader was connecting the products youth created to mathematical ideas (formulas) for how much they could expect to earn from the sale of their products; in terms of work with data, however, youth were not observing or noticing phenomena. This suggests that differences in how work with data was conceptualized and operationalized may lead, in some cases, to codes that do not reflect work with data accurately, and can lead to some findings that seem unexpected given what we know about the potential for work with data to be engaging to youth.

### Summary of Findings for Research Question #4

These findings focused on the affordances and constrained of work with data in summer STEM programs and how instructional support for work with data was measured. Broadly, the qualitative analysis suggested possible explanations for the findings for research questions #2 and #3. For these questions, little variability was found to exist at the momentary level, and the predictors at the momentary level (instructional support for work with data) and at the youth level (pre-interest, gender, and URM status) demonstrated modest relations with the profiles. These relations can be due to a variety of reasons, particularly 1) how the variables for the PECs and how instructional support for work with data is measured, and 2) how suitable of summer STEM programs for work with data. Accordingly, this analysis resulted in findings organized around the following two themes. The first theme concerned *affordances and constraints of summer STEM programs for work with data*. The second concerned *howinstructional support for work with data was measured*. Both are described in the remainder of this section. Another possible explanation related to whether PECs and the variables that make them up are appropriate outcomes, and how the PECS are measured, is an important question, but one that cannot readily be assessed from the video data that was analyzed; however, this topic is explored in the next chapter.

# Discussion

### Key Findings

##### The nature of engagement in summer STEM programs

We can identify profiles of engagement ...

##### What explains PECs

Engagement varies from moment-to-moment ...

##### Summer STEM programs as a context for work with data

### Limitations of the Study

##### Measurement issues

How instructional support for work with data was measured seems to have been an issue, given the qualitative coding ...

##### Context issues

These programs were not designed to support work with data ...

### Recommendations for Future Research

##### Explore work with data in settings designed to support it

There are increasingly &quot;data camps&quot; ...

##### Measure student work with data as well as instructional support for work with data

Measuring what students do in addition to what teachers do is important ...

##### Explore changes in longer-term outcomes

Changes in longer-term outcomes, such as future plans and goals, are an important goal for summer STEM educators and other stakeholders in such programs ...

### Implications for Practice

##### Engage students in complete cycles of investigation

##### Support engagement in specific moments

Viewing engagement in work with data in terms of engagement can help us to build the knowledge base around key data analytic practices for learners. In STEM settings, being engaged predicts key learning-related outcomes (Sinatra et al., 2015). As a consequence, what learners are thinking, feeling, and doing while engaged in work with data, and how challenged or good at data doing any or all of the aspects of work with data they perceive themselves to be, may important predictors of key outcomes and learners’ preparation for future learning (Bransford &amp; Schwartz, 1999), especially for learning in data-rich areas of studies and occupations, such as data science. Engaging in work with data may also prepare learners to think of, understand, and take action based on data in their day-to-day lives.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.5.1</span> Statistical software developed</h3>
<p>The functions in tidyLPA dynamically generate MPlus syntax, so that, for example, a user can simply provide a data frame with variables to be used in the analysis, the specification for one of six models, the number of profiles to be estimated as part of the analysis, and a number of fine-grained options concerning the estimation and the output generated. From these inputs, a data file for MPlus is prepared and saved, the model syntax is created and saved in a model input file, the model is run, and the output, including the “savedata”, or the data with its associated posterior probabilities and profile assignments, is returned to R for use plots or in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Because of the considerable time that it takes to generate MPlus model syntax (i.e., when choosing to specify a model with different parameters or when changing the number of profiles to be estimated as part of the solution), this package makes it easier to carry out LPA in a flexible way, while retaining the power of the MPlus software. While this functionality makes it considerably easier to carry out LPA, it requires that MPlus be purchased and installed. Because of this, the R package I developed also includes wrapper functions to an open-source tool, mclust (Scrucca, Fop, Murphy, &amp; Raftery, 2016). This is a very widely-used package for mixture modeling. While some authors have suggested that it can be used to carry out LPA (Oberski, 2016), a key challenge for analysts using it concerns specifying the models. This is because the models are described in terms of the geometric properties of the multivariate distributions being estimated (i.e., “spherical, equal volume”), rather than in terms of whether and how the means, variances, and covariances are estimated. This R package corresponds LPA models to the mclust models and provides the same functionality that the functions that use MPlus provide, namely, preparing data, running the model, and returning the output or use in subsequent analyses. As part of incorporating the mclust functionality, the functions that use MPlus and those that use mclust have been benchmarked (Rosenberg, 2018). Despite leading to identical results (in most cases) for small datasets, because of differences in how the E-M algorithm is initialized as well as other estimation-related differences, output will likely not be identical for many analyses.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.5.5</span> Model specifications details</h3>
<p>Here, the six models that are possible to specify in LPA are described in terms of how the variables used to create the profiles are estimated. Note that <em>p</em> represents different profiles and each parameterization is represented by a 4 x 4 covariance matrix and therefore would represent the parameterization for a four-profile solution. In all of the models, the means are estimated freely in the different profiles. Imagine that each row and column represents a different variable, i.e., the first row (and column) represents broad interest, the second enjoyment, the third self-efficacy, and the fourth another variable, i.e., future goals and plans. Models 1 and 3 meet the assumption of independence, that is, that, after accounting for their relations with the profile, the variables used to estimate the profiles are independent (Collins &amp; Lanza, 2010). They estimate variable variances but do not estimate covariances (i.e., as can be seen, the covariance matrices are “diagonal,” without any off-diagonal parameters that are estimated). These models are estimated by default in MPlus, although these assumptions can be relaxed (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017). Importantly, this does not mean the variables used to create the profile are assumed to be not related; as Collins and Lanza (2010) explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The local independence assumption refers only to conditioning on the latent variable. It does not imply that in a data set that is to be analyzed, the observed variables are independent. In fact, it is the relations among the observed variables that are explained by the latent classes. An observed data set is a mixture of all the latent classes. Independence is assumed to hold only within each latent class, which is why it is called “local”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the assumption of independence, as Collins and Lanza (2010), Muthen and Muthen (2017), and others (i.e., Pastor et al., 2007; Vermunt &amp; Magidson, 2002) note, it can be lifted to improve model fit, though these models without the assumption of independence may be better described as general or Gaussian mixture models (Fraley et al., 2017).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.5.5.1</span> Varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to 0 (model 1)</h4>
<p>In this model, which corresponds to the mclust model wit the name “EEI”, the variances are estimated to be equal across profiles, indicated by the absence of a p subscript for any of the diagonal elements of the matrix. The covariances are constrained to be zero, as indicated by the 0’s between every combination of the variables. Thus, this model is highly constrained but also parsimonious: the profiles are estimated in such a way that the variables’ variances are identical for each of the profiles, and the relationships between the variables are not estimated. In this way, less degrees of freedom are taken used to explain the observations that make up the data. However, estimating more parameters–as in the other models–may better explain the data, justifying the addition in complexity that their addition involves (and their reduction in degrees of freedom).</p>

<p>This model corresponds to the mclust model “EEE”. In this model, the variances are still constrained to be the same across the profiles, although now the covariances are estimated (but like the variances, are constrained to be the same across profiles). Thus, this model is the first to estimate the covariance (or correlations) of the variables used to create the profiles, thus adding more information that can be used to better understand the characteristics of the profiles (and, potentially, better explain the data).</p>

This solution primarily distinguishes between affective and behavioral engagement; unlike the solution for model 1 with four profiles, there is not a competent but not engaged or challenged profile.

This–and, critically, the lower log-likelihood of the other model 1, six profile solution–suggests that this solution is not preferred.

<p>When investigating an alternate solution (associated with the second lowest log-likelihood) for the model 1, seven profile solution, we can see that even for the solutions associated with other log-likelihoods, the profiles that can be identified are very similar. One minor distinction concerns the <strong>competent but not engaged or challenged</strong> profile, which in the alternate solution is associated with neutral levels of affective engagement, compared to moderately low levels of affective engagement in the solution with the lowest log-likelihood. Because five of the seven profiles associated with both of these model 1, seven profile solutions seem to be distinct from those identified from simpler model 1 solutions, investigation of this alternate solution provides additional evidence that these profiles are not associated with an under-identified model and that simpler models may be preferred over these seven profile solutions.</p>

<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>

<p>The number of observations associated with each solution is fairly balanced, with the most in the challenged profile (<em>n</em> = 1,241), followed by the universally low (<em>n</em> = 954 observations) and competent but not challenged (<em>n</em> = 763) profiles. This solution is very different than the three profile solution that was interpreted for model 1. Model 2 differs from model 1 in that covariances between the variables are estimated (they are constrained to be the same are across the profiles). The log-likelihood was replicated (at least) ten times. Thus, this and other solutions associated with model 2 include information about how the variables relate. Including this information seems to be associated with profiles that differentiate the groups on the basis of the levels of each of the variables in more distinct ways: the model 1, three profile solution was characterized by high, moderate, or low levels of all variables for each of the three profiles.</p>

<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>universally low</strong> profile, profile 1</li>
<li>a <strong>challenged</strong> profile, profile 2</li>
<li>a <strong>highly challenged</strong> profile, profile 4</li>
<li>an <strong>engaged and competent but not challenged</strong> profile, profile 3</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations in each of the profiles is not very balanced, with more than 1,000 observations in both the universally low (<em>n</em> = 1,029) and challenged (<em>n</em> = 1,106) profiles, a moderate number if the engaged and competent but not challenged profile (<em>n</em> = 688), and very few in the highly challenged (<em>n</em> = 135) profile. The log-likelihood was replicated three times. While each of these profiles has been identified in another solution, the small number of observations in the highly challenged profile suggests that this solution be interpreted with some skepticism because of the potentially limited utility (and statistical power associated with the use) of the profiles in subsequent analyses.</p>

<div id="model-2-profiles-5" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.5.7.3</span> Model: 2, Profiles: 5</h4>
<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>universally low</strong> profile, profile 1</li>
<li>a <strong>full</strong> profile, profile 4, although with very high levels of challenged (in addition to high levels of all of the other variables), making this profile similar to that (challenged) profile</li>
<li>a <strong>highly challenged</strong> profile, profile 5</li>
<li>an <strong>all moderate</strong> profile, profile 3, although with moderately lower levels of competence than is found in profiles associated with other solutions</li>
<li>a <strong>competent but not challenged</strong> profile, profile 2, similar to the competent but not challenged or engaged profile, but with neutral, rather than low, levels of the engagement variables</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is not very balanced, with a very large number of observations in the all moderate profile (<em>n</em> = 1,113) and a large number in the competent but not challenged profile (<em>n</em> = 871), a moderate number in the full profile (<em>n</em> = 573), and very few in the universally low (<em>n</em> = 271) and challenged but not competent (<em>n</em> = 130) profiles. The log-likelihood was replicated four times. Like for the model 2, four profile solution, the small number of observations associated with two of the profiles suggests that this solution should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
