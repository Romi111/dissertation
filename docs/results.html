<p>First, descriptive statistics for all of the study variables–overall pre-interest, the five variables that are used to estimate the PECs, and the variables for each of the five aspects of work with data (which are dichotomous variables)–are presented. Overall pre-interest and the variables used to estimate the PECs are presented first. The composite variable for instructional support for work with data was constructed as the sum of each of the five dichotomous variables that represented the aspects of instructional support for work with data; thus, its possible values ranged between zero and five.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Correlations among study variables</h3>
<p>Next, correlations between individual aspects of work with data (and the composite) and the variables that are used to create the PECs are presented. These correlations suggest that the aspects of work with data are not related to the aspects of work with data to a large degree, which is not surprising given the small ICC values for the momentary level, as the aspects of work with data are associated with this level. Most noteworthy is the very small correlations between the aspects of work with data and the profiles; these correlations range (in absolute values) from .00 to .05. Only the relations between communicating and profile six are statistically significant. The composite variable was correlated with the profiles from (in absolute values) 0.002 to 0.035, none statistically significant. The aspects of work with data are modestly correlated with one another, with correlations ranging from .16 to .46; all were significant. The Spearman rank correlations were also considered for all of the correlations that involved the individual aspects of instructional support for work with data; these are presented in the appendix because these were all within a .02 value (i.e., each Spearman’s <em>rho</em> compared to its corresponding Pearson’s <em>r</em> was within .02).</p>

<p>From the coding with the STEM-PQA, work with data appears common. Out of the 248 segments, 236 were coded for instructional support for work with data; for the other, not-coded segments, issues with the video-recordings were the primary source of the missing data; in these cases, students may have still replied to signals, but it was not possible to code for instructional support for work with data associated with these responses.</p>

<p>The composite measure, created on the basis of summing the codes for the five aspects of work with data, has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum of 5. Its mean is 1.86 (<em>SD</em> = 1.61). This indicates that, on average, youth were engaged in 1.86 aspects of the work with data during the program.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.3</span> How instructional support for work with data was measured</h4>
<p>This theme concerned how instructional support was measured and how this impacted the findings presented in research questions #2 and #3. As an example, in a video associated with a mathematics-focused activity in the Comunidad de Aprendizaje program, a youth activity leader is discussing with youth opportunities for them to market products that they developed to sell in their communities and highlighting the expense of creating the product, its sale price, and its potential process. In this example, observing data is coded, but this aspect of instructional support for work with data does not appear to be present. Considering the STEM-PQA code on which the code for making observations is based, this difference is possibly due to a distinction in what both codes are focused on. The STEM-PQA code is for <em>classifying or abstracting</em>, and its operationalization emphasizes staff supporting youth in linking concrete examples to principles, categories, or formulas. The conceptual definition of <em>making observations</em>, though, emphasizes watching and noticing what is happening with respect to the phenomena being investigated. In this case, the application of the STEM-PQA code was sensible, as the youth activity leader was connecting the products youth created to mathematical ideas (formulas) for how much they could expect to earn from the sale of their products; in terms of work with data, however, youth were not observing or noticing phenomena. This suggests that differences in how work with data was conceptualized and operationalized may lead, in some cases, to codes that do not reflect work with data accurately, and can lead to some findings that seem unexpected given what we know about the potential for work with data to be engaging to youth.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1.1</span> Examination of specific candidate models</h4>
<p>Following from the in-depth exploration of the candidate solutions (described in the Appendix), in this section, model solutions associated with specific model types and the number of profiles are investigated. In particular, the model one type, six profile, and model one type, seven profile solutions are described. Descriptions of other candidate solutions is included in the appendix. For all of the solutions, the raw data and the data that are centered to have a mean equal to 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (thus, the y-axis on each of the plots is labeled “Z-score”).</p>
<div id="model-type-1-profiles-6" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1.1.1</span> Model type: 1, Profiles: 6</h5>
<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>full</em> profile, profile 6</li>
<li>An <em>universally low</em> profile, profile 2</li>
<li>An <em>all moderate</em> profile, profile 5–and, like, the model 1, six profile solution–with moderate levels of affective engagement</li>
<li>An <em>only behaviorally engaged</em> profile, profile 1, with moderate levels of behavioral engagement, very low affective engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <em>only affectively engaged</em> profile, profile 4, with moderate levels of affective engagement, low levels of behavioral engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <em>engaged and competent but not challenged</em> profile, profile 3, characterized by high levels of each of the three dimensions of engagement and of competence, but with low levels of challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is somewhat balanced, with the universally low profile with the largest number of observations (<em>n</em> = 667; the same number for this profile as in the model 1, five profile solution), followed by the all moderate profile (<em>n</em> = 638). Each of the other four profiles were associated with 300 to 400 observations. Unlike the model 1, four and five profile solutions, which distinguished observations on <em>either</em> a condition of engagement (i.e., competence) or one of its dimensions (i.e., cognitive, behavioral, and affective), this solution was associated with profiles that distinguished observations on the basis of both: There were profiles for only behaviorally and affectively engaged and for engaged and competent but not challenged. This solution is compelling because it appears to group students on the basis of multiple of the indicators, and demonstrate viability on the basis of the fit statistics (i.e., the tables and figure). The log-likelihood was replicated two times, with the next lowest log-likelihood not being replicated, followed by a log-likelihood that was replicated (at least) seven times. This solution (associated with the log-likelihood that was replicated [at least] seven times) could be investigated in further detail, to see whether–and if so, how–it differs from the solution interpreted here. This solution is a strong candidate for use in subsequent analyses.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1.1.2</span> Looking across model 1 and model 2 type solutions</h5>
<p>The model 1, six and seven profile solutions are compelling because both show profiles that are distinguished by dimensions of engagement and its conditions (challenge and competence). Note that for this model, only the means and variances are estimated (and so no covariances are estimated), and the variances are constrained to be the same across the profiles. While this is a very restrictive model, it, along with the model 3 type (which did not lead to solutions for any of the numbers of profiles specified) also is a standard model for LPA, in that it meets the assumption of local independence (of the variables that make up the profiles–unlike for models in which covariances are estimated) typical common to LPA (see Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2016). While some of the solutions associated with the model 2 type did reach solutions, these demonstrated less appealing properties in terms of their fit statistics as well as their interpretability and with respect to concerns of parsimony. Thus, while no covariances are estimated for the model 1 type solutions, there is no requirement that these be specified; their benefit, when models associated with them are preferred, is that they can provide better fit: they can be used to better explain or predict the data in a sample, but their inclusion also means that over-fitting the model to the data can become a greater concern.</p>
<p>For each solution, alternate solutions associated with higher log-likelihoods were explored. One advantage of the six profile solution is that most of its profiles can also be identified in solutions with fewer profiles. For the six profile solutions, this alternate solution was very different, whereas for the seven profile solutions, this alternate solution was highly similar. The model solutions exhibit a less clear pattern in terms of which profiles appear when. All else being equal, on the basis of parsimony, the model 1, six profile solution may be preferred and is selected for use in subsequent analyses.</p>

<div id="null-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Null models</h3>
<p>The null models presented in the table provide insight into the levels at which predictors may be able to explain the outcome. For all six profiles, the ICCs were very small, from 0.00 to 0.023. This suggests that very little variability can be explained simply by the program. For the momentary level, the ICCs were also very small, ranging from 0.004 to 0.011. Finally, the youth-level ICCs ranged from .099 to .427. Looking across these values, considering variability at the program, momentary, and youth levels, most of the explained variability in the responses is associated with youth; the program and momentary levels were associated with very small values, suggesting that variables at these levels have minimal variability to explain. In turn, this suggests that these variables, including those for instructional support for work with data, may not have strong effects in terms of their relations with the PECs.</p>
<p>In terms of specific ICCs at the youth level, the value for the youth-level ICC was highest for the <em>full</em> profile, suggesting that some youth have a strong tendency to be fully engaged (possibly due to their initial interest or other individual characteristics and differences). The other profile characterized by a consistent pattern across all of the variables–the <em>universally low</em> profile–had a modest ICC, .265. Finally, a large amount of variability is associated with the residual (variance that is not associated with the program, momentary, or youth levels). This suggests that there is wide variation in students’ responses that may not be readily explained or predicted.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Models with variables for aspects of instructional support for work with data added separately</h3>
<p>When the predictor variables for work with data are added, some overall patterns and specific findings can be identified. The only relations with <em>p</em>-values that were below the criterion for statistical significance (.05) were for the relations between modeling data and the <em>full</em> profile (<em>B</em> = 0.036 (0.016), <em>p</em> = .016) and between generating data and the full profile (<em>B</em> = 0.029 (0.015), <em>p</em> = .024).</p>
<p>Adding these variables changed the (conditional upon the random effects) r-squared values from, .002 to .018, very small changes suggesting that the aspects of work with data do not strongly predict the PECs. This is in-line with the correlations for these variables with those variables that make up the profiles, and the ICC values at the momentary level.</p>
<p>The sensitivity analysis for the effect of generating data suggested that 1.884% of the inference would have to be due to bias to invalidate the inference, suggesting that this effect is not very robust to potential sources of bias, such as an omitted (in this analysis) confounding (or control) variable. For the effect of modeling, 9.835% would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. This effect, then, is less sensitive to possible sources of bias, but is still not highly robust.</p>

<div id="models-with-the-composite-added" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Models with the composite added</h3>
<p>For the composite of work with data, the composite predicted the profile for <em>only behavioral</em> (<em>B</em> = 0.007 (0.004), <em>p</em> = .021), but not any of the other profiles. However, this coefficient is very small in practical terms, and 12.261% would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. The change in r-squared values ranged from .003 to .020, suggesting minimal potential relations among factors (such as support for work with data as measured by the composite variable) at the momentary level. When the composite was treated as a dichotomous (instead of a continuous) variable, so that the variable takes a value of one if any of the aspects of work with data are present, the results are similar in terms of the magnitude of the effects and their significance, as none of the relations are statistically significant when the dichotomous variable is used.</p>

<div id="summary-of-findings-for-research-question-2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Summary of findings for research question #2</h3>
<p>When looking across findings, we find few relations between instructional support for work with data and the profiles, though there were notable effects of modeling, though they were small effects (i.e., when students are doing this, they are around 3% more likely to be responding in a way associated with the <em>full</em> profile).</p>
<p>[add table]</p>
<p>The composite for work with data had a relation of around 0.01 with the <em>only behavioral</em> profile, suggesting that for each one-value increase in the composite (which has a range from one to five), this profile is around 1% more likely. These findings are similar to those obtained when the model 1 type, seven profile solution is used for the outcome variables; see the appendix for more detail. Broadly, further explanations and investigations of these effects –focusing on the characteristics of instructional support for work with data in the context of summer STEM programs and how this support is measured in terms of codes from the video–are the focus on research question #4 and are discussed in the next chapter. Moreover, these findings are deepened in subsequent analyses for research questions #3.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Models with pre interest, gender, and under-represented minority (URM) status</h3>
<p>These results show that overall pre-interest is associated with the <em>engaged and competent but not challenged</em> profile (<em>B</em> = 0.039 (0.021), p = .009). The effect of being a female has a relation of 0.059 (0.036, p = .054) upon the probability of a response being associated with the <em>universally low</em> profile; though this effect did not meet the criteria for statistical significance, sensitivity analysis to determine how much more robust the effect would need to be to make an inference. For the effect of overall pre-interest upon the <em>engaged and competent but not challenged</em> profile, 17.879% would be needed to invalidate the inference, suggesting a moderately robust effect. For the effect of gender upon the <em>universally low</em> profile, 16.996% of the bias would need to be removed (or the effect would need to be larger by this percentage) to sustain the inference. The change in r-squared values ranged from .004 to .007, suggesting that pre-interest and other individual characteristics - in addition to the aspects of work with data - have minimal relations with the PECs. Thai is more surprising than the similarly minimal relations observed for work with data: as the null models indicate, there were large ICCs (a large proportion of the variability in the outcome variables) at the youth-level (as pre-interest, gender, and URM status are variables associated with this level) This is discussed further in the next chapter.</p>

<p>These results show very similar patterns to those observed in the models with pre-interest and the other individual characteristics and the models with the aspects of work with data separate. Like in the models with only pre-interest and the other individual characteristics, pre-interest is related to the <em>only behavioral</em> profile (<em>B</em> = 0.039 (0.016), p = .009). Being female is again related but not to a level that it meets the criteria for statistical significance (<em>B</em> = 0.06 (0.037), p = .051). Generating data (<em>B</em> = 0.027 (0.015), p = .033) and modeling data (<em>B</em> = 0.034 (0.017), p = .020) were both related to the <em>full</em> profile to a similar extent and with similar robustness as found in the separate models. Compared to the null models, the r-squared values changed from .001 to .029, suggesting small improvements from the additions of the individual characteristics and the codes for the aspects of work with data.</p>

These results show very similar patterns to those observed in the models with pre-interest and the other individual characteristics and the models with the aspects of work with data separate. Like in the models with only pre-interest and the other individual characteristics alone (and like in the model with the individual aspects), pre-interest is related to the <em>only behavioral</em> profile (<em>B</em> = 0.039 (0.016), p = .009). Being female is again related but not to a level that it meets the criteria for statistical significance (<em>B</em> = 0.06 (0.037), p = .052).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.4</span> Models with interactions between pre interest, gender, and URM status and work with data composite</h3>
<p>These results show similar patterns to the earlier models.Like in the models with only pre-interest and the other individual characteristics alone (and like in the model with the individual aspects), pre-interest is related to the <em>only behavioral</em> profile (<em>B</em> = 0.033 (0.018), p = .033). Being female is again related but not to a level that it meets the criteria for statistical significance (<em>B</em> = 0.064 (0.041), p = .059). With the interactions added, the composite was no significantly related to the <em>only behavioral</em> profile (<em>B</em> = 0.016 (0.016), p = .156) to a similar extent and with similar robustness as found in the separate model. One interaction, between pre-interest and being female, had a significant effect upon the profile for <em>full</em> engagement (<em>B</em> = 0.012 (0.006), p = .026). However, only 1.953% of the effect would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. The r-squared values, relative to the models with only random effects (the null models), increased from .003 to .028, again suggesting small effects of the predictors upon the PECs.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.5</span> Summary of findings for research question #3</h3>
<p>When looking across findings, we find minimal relations between pre-interest and other individual characteristics.</p>
<p>[add table]</p>
<p>In particular, we found that pre-interest was related to the <em>engaged and comptent but not challenged</em> profile to a modest extent. Being female did not demonstrate statistically significant relations with the <em>univerally low</em> profile, though some moderately-sized effects that were nearly statistically significant were observed and interpreted in terms of how much bias would need to be reduced (or how much the larger the effect would need to be) in order for this relation to be statistically significant. These results, like those for research question #2, are similar to those obtained when the model 1 type, seven profile solution is used for the outcome variables. There were few interactive effects observed; the magnitude of the effect of the composite and gender interaction was small (as were the changes in the r-squared value as a consequence of adding this interaction), and the effect appears to not be highly robust to potential sources of bias. Like for research question #2, reasons for why this may be are explored in the next chapter. The effect of the activity appears robust, as in research question #3.</p>
