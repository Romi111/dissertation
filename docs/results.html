<p>First, descriptive statistics for the engagement measures (the five variables that were used to estimate the profiles) are presented in Table 4.1. These values suggest moderately high levels of the three dimensions of engagement (with mean values between 2.768 (<em>SD</em> = 1.063) for cognitive engagement, and 2.863 (<em>SD</em> = 1.044), for behavioral engagement, on one-four scales) and high perceptions of competence (<em>M</em> = 3.000 (<em>SD</em> = 0.952)); the only continuous variable that was not measured using ESM) and lower perceptions of challenge (<em>M</em> = 2.270 (<em>SD</em> = 1.117)).</p>

<p>Of the 236 instructional episodes, 170 (72%) were coded as involving <em>any</em> of the aspects of work with data. These 236 episodes are used as the sample for this study because the proportion of episodes that included any of the aspects of work with data is a question asked in this study. Table 4.3 includes the frequency of the specific aspects of work with data, with interpreting and communicating findings being the most present (occurring in 47% of the coded instructional episodes), followed by generating data (in 45% of the instructional episodes), asking questions (in 39%), data modeling (29%), and then making observations (26%).</p>

<p>Note that these results are for codes applied to approximately ten-minute (video-recorded) instructional episodes and that the aspects of work with data could co-occur. On average, there were 1.86 (<em>SD</em> = 1.61) aspects of work with data present in each 10-minute instructional episode. This indicates that, on average, youth were engaged in around two of aspects of the work with data during each instructional episode. There was considerable variation in the extent to which these types of work with data were supported in each program (see Appendix C).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-nature-of-work-with-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> The nature of work with data</h3>
<p>For these results, the different aspects of work with data were looked at in more detail using an open-ended, qualitative approach in order to better understand the nuance and the specific nature of what was going on during these episodes in terms of how students work with data. This coding, which showed there to be distinct, qualitative differences in the particular ways youth worked with data when, for example, they were data modeling, resulted in approximately three to four sentence notes from each of two raters for every instructional episode and showed the specific nature of work with data.</p>
<!-- One affordance of these programs relevant to these informal and to K-12 learning environments concerns selecting activities that are engaging to youth.  This appeared to be a powerful activity, one that was coded as involving all five aspects of work with data according to the measures for instructional support for work with data; this type of activity seemed to suggest that instructional support for work with data may impact youth's engagement. -->
<!-- Another affordance concerned the relevance of the program to youth's lives. For example, in the *Building Mania* program, youth are involved in engineering design (i.e., identifying a problem and designing a solution), particularly around the use of simple machines. In a day in the classroom setting, youth are creating, testing, and revising catapults. In the next day, youth visit an area University, and are led in a discussion by a physicist who works with particle colliders. In this example, the expertise of the physicist, who explicitly mentions the benefits of engaging in the engineering design process and the importance of combining engineering to addressing problems (such as mitigating the damage of earthquakes), seems to be highly relevant to what youth are doing in their class. In these two days of class, youth are engaged in different aspects of work with data as indicated by the codes for instructional support for work with data (collecting data on the efficacy of their designs in the classroom day, and asking questions in the subsequent day, particularly); these seem to suggest, like the example of work work with data from the *Marine Investigators* program, affordances of work with data for summer STEM programs. -->
<!-- different aspects of instructional support for work with data were emphasized to different degrees based on the focus of the program. -->
<div id="asking-questions-or-identifying-problems" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.1</span> Asking questions or identifying problems</h4>
<p>Among the instructional episodes that included the asking questions aspect of work with data (as determined through coding with the STEM-PQA measure), creating qualitative descriptions revealed that around one-third (36/92, or 39%) were focused on asking questions focused on youth working to understand the phenomenon or problem they were investigating. For example, in an instructional episode during the <em>Ecosphere</em> program in which youth constructed inclined tables to study how water moved throughout the ecosystem, the youth activity leader prompted youth to generate hypotheses of what would happen when water was poured onto the table, before pouring the water.</p>
<p>Other instructional episodes involved questions that were not focused on predicting, conjecturing, or hypothesizing. In such cases (56/92; 61%), youth were asking generic questions (i.e., about how they do an assignment) or when the instructor was asking youth questions (i.e., math-related questions). For example, in the <em>Marine Investigators</em> program, youth visited a water treatment site, and were provided opportunities to ask questions about what they observed.</p>
</div>
<div id="making-observations" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.2</span> Making observations</h4>
<p>In the instructional episodes during which the STEM-PQA revealed that youth were making observations, the vast majority (49/57, or 86%) of these were focused on observing phenomenon in the field, or, in the case of engineering-focused programs, noticing what was going on with a particular design. For example, in the <em>Building Mania</em> program, youth constructed Rube Goldberg machines; youth were prompted by the activity leaders to notice how changes in their design led to differences in how far objects were launched or rolled.</p>
<p>Sometimes, while youth did make observations of phenomena, they faced the challenge of using that data in subsequent activities and through engaging in other aspects of work with data. For example, the science-focused programs (<em>Island Explorers</em>, <em>The Ecosphere</em>, and <em>Marine Investigators</em>) all emphasized making observations, but these observations were not frequently written down or entered into a spreadsheet as data. For example, in <em>Marine Investigators</em>, youth observed how the Atlantic Ocean brings salt water into the (freshwater) bay. Youth observe “buffers” between the salt and freshwater, but do not collect or otherwise generate data related to their observations.</p>
<p>In a relatively small number of cases (8/57; 14%) making observations was focused on making observations not of phenomena, but of the instructor. For example, in the <em>Adventures in Mathematics</em> program, instances in which youth observed other youth or the youth activity leader solving a mathematics problem was often coded as involving making observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="generating-data" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.3</span> Generating data</h4>
<p>Around half (48/102; 47%) of these episodes, for youth generating sources of data (as indicated by the STEM-PQA), the instructional episodes were focused around writing down observations made of a phenomenon, recording information from experiments, or recording the results of a trial (in engineering contexts). For example, in the <em>Marine Investigators</em> program, youth collected pieces of recyclable plastic, bringing them back to the classroom and counting them for each location they were collected.</p>
<p>As described above, there were cases in which youth made observations but did not record data or use their observations as a context to generate data. Similarly, in a number of the cases in which youth generated data, they did not use the data they generated in subsequent activities. In the engineering-focused programs (<em>Uptown Architecture</em>, <em>Crazy Machines</em>, and <em>Dorchester House</em>, youth often generated data that resulted from their engineering designs (and communicated and interpreted their findings,) but did not model this data as a regular part of their activities.</p>
<p>The remaining cases (54/102; 53%) were most often instructional episodes in which youth were writing down what the youth activity leader was saying or were focused on collecting specimens (but not writing them down) entering them into a spreadsheet, or otherwise recording them as data. For example, again in the <em>Marine Investigators</em> program, youth used nets to collect saltwater organisms, which they then transported in buckets back to the classroom setting for subsequent analysis. While these specimens could be considered as data, at least in the instructional episode described, youth did not inscribe notes or any other observations on the specimens they were collecting, and so data was not generated (at this stage). In another example, in the <em>Ecosphere</em> program, youth collected water samples in the field. They then brought these samples to the classroom and tested the water, involving students in both collecting and, to a degree, generating data (by noting the pH levels of the water). However, later in the day, youth created a small-scale model (with inclined trays of dirt, rocks, and plants) of an ecosystem, in which they added food coloring to determine the impacts of chemicals and acid rain. Youth then interpreted and discussed these findings, but did not connect the discussion to the water samples youth collected and tested earlier. This activity presented an opportunity for deeper engagement in generating data through using generated data in subsequent activities, in which youth could interpret and communicate findings related to the state of the water in their ecosystem; but, instead, it was potentially limiting in terms of youth’s engagement in work with data.</p>

<div id="data-modeling" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.4</span> Data modeling</h4>
<p>A large majority (49/68, 72%) of the instructional episodes coded (with the STEM-PQA) for data modeling were focused on youths’ uses of statistical and mathematical models. For example, in the <em>Comunidad de Aprendizaje</em> program, youth accessed nationally-representative data and were tasked to solve problems, like finding out what percentage of people engage in particular activities, like donating to charity. In another example, in the <em>Marine Investigators</em>, youth participated in activities designed to help them understand water quality in their ecosystem. Youth collected trash from sites around their community (in different “districts”) and then brought the trash and recyclable plastic back to the classroom. Then, the youth activity leaders involved youth in an ambitious data modeling activity. The aim was to figure out how much plastic enters local waterways. As a part of this activity, youth activity leaders asked youth not only to determine the quantity of trash that entered the waterways, but asked youth about <em>why</em> youth thought about and used math in particular ways (i.e., by adding the quantity of trash collected and then extrapolating from this quantity to the amount from across the entire city over the course of the year). This appeared to be an ambitious and powerful data modeling activity.</p>
<p>Related, while the data modeling activities were often ambitious, youth activity leaders sometimes faced the challenge of linking data modeling activities to other aspects of work with data. For example, the mathematics-focused programs, such as the <em>Adventures in Mathematics</em> program, the youth activity leaders recognizing that youth had difficulty solving equations, used duct tape and a “hippity hoppity”, building on an earlier activity in which youth considered what constituted a rate, on how many “hops” it would take someone to move from one end of the line of duct tape to the other; the youth activity leader than asked youth to consider how far they could move in one hop and to consider how they could find out many hops it would take, using a mathematical equation. In this activity, youth were supported in their attempts to approach mathematics problem-solving in creative ways. However, apart from data modeling, other aspects of work with data were rarely present, and most of the data that youth worked with was provided by the teacher or considered in the abstract.</p>
<p>In a smaller number of instructional episodes not focused on ambitious data modeling activities (19/68; 28%), this aspect of work with data was present when the youth activity leader, rather than students, was doing the modeling, or the model was not one that could generate data. For example, in the <em>Marine Investigators</em> program, a youth activity leader used a plush toy seal designed to teach youth about anatomy and the dangers of aquatic mammals consuming trash and recyclables.</p>

<div id="interpreting-and-communicating-findings" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.5</span> Interpreting and communicating findings</h4>
<p>In around half (49/103, 48%) of the instructional episodes in which youth were interpreting and communicating findings (as coded by the STEM-PQA), youth were sharing what they found from an investigation or the results of using the product they designed. For example, in the <em>Comunidad de Aprendizaje</em> program, youth participated in an activity designed to support their thinking about creating a product to bring to market; the youth activity leaders described this as being akin to the television show the <em>Shark Tank</em>. In one instructional episode, the youth activity leader asks youth to think of an idea that would make an investor willing to invest in; students shared their ideas, describing what their ideas was, why it was a good idea, how much they could sell it for, and what their profit would be, while fielding questions from youth activity leaders and their peers. Interpreting and communicating findings was also commonly present in instructional episodes in which youth were debating the findings of an investigation, such as the results of calculations for the amount of recyclables entering waterways (in <em>Marine Investigators</em>).</p>
<p>In the approximately half of the responses that were not focused on youth sharing what they found from an investigation (54/103, 52%), youth were most commonly communicating about topics other than the results of an investigation or design process, such as trying to find out the answer to a question posed by the youth activity leader, or the youth activity leader was who was doing the interpreting and communicating. For example, in the <em>Adventures in Mathematics</em> program, the youth activity leader helped youth to solve problems on a worksheet, asking guiding questions to help youth start to solve problems on their own.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Results for Research Question #2: What profiles of youth engagement and its conditions emerge from experiential data collected in the programs?</h2>
<p>A relatively simple model (model <em>one</em> type; with varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to 0) with six profiles was selected for use in subsequent analyses. This model has profiles characterized by both varying levels on both the dimensions of engagement–cognitive, behavioral, and affective–and youths’ perceptions of challenge and competence. In addition, the number of observations across the profiles is relatively balanced.</p>
<p>This means that <em>six distinct profiles</em> were identified in the data. This selection was on the basis of fit statistics, statistical tests, and concerns of interpretability and parsimony. The solution demonstrated superior fit on the basis of the information criteria (AIC and BIC) and on the basis of the measure of classification accuracy (entropy). Note that a seven profile solution with the same specifications regarding means, variances and covariances was also a similarly good fit (and is presented in Appendix F), but the six profile solution was ultimately chosen on the basis of parsimony and interpretability.</p>
<p>For the six profiles, presented below in Figure 4.1 and 4.2. Figure 4.1 shows the profiles with variables that were centered to have a mean equal to 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Thus, the y-axis for this plot is labeled “Z-score”).Figure 4.2 shows the profiles with the raw data (not transformed). Thus, the <em>y</em>-axis for this plot is labeled “Value.”</p>

<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>universally low</em> profile, characterized by low levels of engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <em>only behaviorally engaged</em> profile, with moderate levels of behavioral engagement, very low affective engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <em>only affectively engaged</em> profile, with moderate levels of affective engagement, low levels of behavioral engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>A <em>all moderate</em> profile, with moderate levels of the three dimensions of engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <em>engaged and competent but not challenged</em> profile, characterized by high levels of each of the three dimensions of engagement and of competence, but with low levels of challenge</li>
<li>A <em>full</em> profile, with high levels of engagement, challenge, and competence</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is somewhat balanced, with the universally low profile with the largest number of observations (<em>n</em> = 667), followed by the all moderate profile (<em>n</em> = 638). Each of the other four profiles were associated with 300 to 400 observations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Results for Research Question #3: What sources of variability are there for the profiles of engagement?</h2>
<p>The remaining analyses use the six profiles described above. For all six profiles, the ICCs at the program level were very small, from 0.00 to 0.023. This suggests that very little variability can be explained simply by the program. For the instructional episode level, the ICCs were also very small, ranging from 0.004 to 0.011. Finally, the youth-level ICCs ranged from .099 to .427.</p>

<p>Looking across these values, most of the explained variability in the responses is associated with youth; the program and instructional episode levels were associated with very small values, suggesting that variables at these levels have minimal variability to explain. In turn, this suggests that these variables, including those for work with data, may not have strong effects in terms of their relations with the profiles.</p>
<p>In terms of specific ICCs at the youth level, the value for the youth-level ICC was highest for the <em>Full</em> profile (<em>ICC</em> = .432), suggesting that some youth have a strong tendency to be fully engaged (possibly due to their initial interest or other individual characteristics and differences). The other profile characterized by a consistent pattern across all of the variables–the <em>Universally low</em> profile–had a modest value (<em>ICC</em> = .265). Finally, a large amount of variability is associated with the residual (variance that is not associated with the program, instructional episode, or youth levels). This suggests that there is wide variation in students’ responses that may not be readily explained or predicted by variables <em>at one level alone</em>. Remaining unexplained variability is the product of youth, instructional episode, and program effects together. Some youth from particular programs may engage during some episode instructional episodes in very high or low ways that are not captured by modeling the variability at each of these levels alone.</p>
<p>As presented in Figure 4.3, the value of the mean for the proportion of responses for each youth in the profile they reported most was .540 (<em>SD</em> = .194, <em>min</em> = .182, <em>max</em> = 1.00). When <em>Full</em> engagement was reported by a youth more than any other profile, they reported it, on average, in just over 60% of their responses. No other profile that youth reported most was associated (on average) with a larger proportion of their responses. This suggests that even when youth report (relatively) stable engagement over the course of their time in the programs, they still engage in a variety of different ways. When youth reported <em>All moderate</em> engagement (the profile with the lowest proportion of responses, on average, when reported more than any other), they reported it in just less than 40% of their responses. This suggests that though youth may report one profile far more than others–and that youth who report particular (i.e., <em>Full</em>) profiles more than others may reflect somewhat stable engagement, there still exists substantial variability in youths’ engagement.</p>
<p>In sum, these findings show substantial variabiliy in the profiles present at the youth level, with less explained by the program youth were in or the nature of the particular instructional episode present at the time youth were signaled.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Results for Research Question #4: Aspects of work with data and engagement</h2>
<p>The results for this and the next research question are presented in Table 4.5. In this table, each column represent the output from one of the six different models. For example, the first column includes the results for the model with the probability of a response being associated with the <em>Only behavioral</em> profile as the dependent variable. The cells down the rows contain the coefficients (and their standard errors and (<em>p</em>-values)) for each of the predictor variables.</p>
<p>Only the coefficients associated with the aspects of work with data are interpreted in this section in order to provide results for this research question, because the youth characteristics are interpreted for research question #5. As described earlier, the results were practically the same for these sets of predictors being included in either separate or the same model, so they are included in the same model.</p>
<p>Note that there were only significant relations with the <em>Full</em> profile (see the column with the column name <em>Full</em> for these results). The only relations that were statistically significant were for the relations between modeling data and the <em>Full</em> profile (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.034 (0.017), <em>p</em> = .020) and between generating data and the <em>Full</em> profile (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.027 (0.015), <em>p</em> = .033): When youth were either modeling or generating data, they were more likely to be fully engaged.</p>
<p>After finding there to be few relations between the aspects of work with data and engagement, sensitivity analysis for the statistical significant effects was carried out. This revealed that the effect of modeling data on <em>Full</em> engagement was more robust than that for generating data (also upon <em>Full</em> engagement): 9.835% of the effect of modeling would have to be due to bias to invalidate the inference about its effect, whereas only 1.884% of the effect of generating data would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference about its effect. Further explanations and investigations of these effects are the focus on research question #5 (in terms of the effect of youth characteristics) and are also discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<div id="results-for-research-question-5-youth-characteristics-and-engagement" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Results for Research Question #5: Youth characteristics and engagement</h2>
<p>Like for the results for research question #4, each column is associated with the results for a single model, again in Table 4.5. For example, the first row is again associated with the results for the model predicting the probability of the <em>Only behavioral</em> profile, with the cells across the columns containing the coefficients, their standard errors, and their <em>p</em>-values. These results show that overall pre-interest is associated with the <em>Engaged and competent but not challenged</em> profile (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = 0.039 (0.016), <em>p</em> = .009). For this effect, 17.879% would be needed to invalidate the inference, suggesting a moderately robust effect. The effect of being a female was not statistically significant but has a relation of 0.060 (0.037, <em>p</em> = .051) upon the probability of a response being associated with the <em>Universally low</em> profile. For the effect of gender upon the <em>Universally low</em> profile, 17.843% of the bias would need to be removed (or the effect would need to be larger by this percentage) to sustain the inference.</p>
<p>These few, small findings were more surprising than the similarly minimal relations observed for work with data: as the null models indicate, there were large ICCs (a large proportion of the variability in the outcome variables) at the youth-level (as pre-interest, gender, and URM status were variables associated with this level). However it appears that the youth level variables of interest to this study were not effective at explaining much of this variability. This is discussed further in the next chapter.</p>
