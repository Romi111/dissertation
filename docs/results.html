<p>First, descriptive statistics for all of the study variables–overall pre-interest, the five variables that are used to estimate the PECs, and the variables for each of the five aspects of work with data (which are dichotomous variables)–are presented. Overall pre-interest and the variables used to estimate the PECs are presented first. The composite variable for instructional support for work with data was constructed as the sum of each of the five dichotomous variables that represented the aspects of instructional support for work with data; thus, its possible values ranged vetween zero and five.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Correlations between individual aspects of work with data and the composite and the variables that make up the profiles and individual interest</h3>
<p>Next, correlations between individual aspects of work with data (and the composite) and the variables that are used to create the PECs are presented. These correlations suggest that the aspects of work with data are not related to the aspects of work with data to a large degree, which is not surprising given the small ICC values for the momentary level, as the aspects of work with data are associated with this level. Most noteworthy is the very small correlations between the aspects of work with data and the profiles; these correlations range (in absolute values) from .00 to .05. Only the relations between communicating and profile six are statistically significant. The composite variable was correlated with the profiles from (in absolute values) 0.002 to 0.035, none statistically significant. The aspects of work with data are modestly correlated with one another, with correlations ranging from .16 to .46; all were significant. The Spearman rank correlations were also considered for all of the correlations that involved the individual aspects of instructional support for work with data; these are presented in the appendix because these were all within a .02 value (i.e., each Spearman’s <em>rho</em> compared to its corresponding Pearson’s <em>r</em> was within .02).</p>

<p>From the coding with the STEM-PQA, work with data appears common. Out of the 248 segments, 236 were coded for instructional support for work with data; for the other, not-coded segments, issues with the video-recordings were the primary source of the missing data; in these cases, students may have still replied to signals, but it was not possible to code for instructional support for work with data associated with these responses.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Research Question #1: Profiles of Engagement and Its Conditions (PECs)</h2>
<p>This question addresses what profiles emerged from the data. This section first provides information about the statistical software that was developed and solutions for all models (whether models converged and the log-likelihood was replicated). Then, fit statistics for models that converged and for which the log-likelihood was replicated are described, followed by a comparison of specific, candidate solutions. At the end of this section, models selected are described in detail.</p>
<div id="statistical-software-developed" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Statistical software developed</h3>
<p>The MPlus software is used to carry out LPA as part of this study. In order to more flexibly carry out LPA, an open-source tool, tidyLPA (Rosenberg, Schmidt, Beymer, &amp; Steingut, 2018), was developed. This tool provides interfaces toboth the MPlus software and to the open-source mclust software. In addition to being used as part of this study, this package is provided free of use to other analysts as the first tool dedicated to carrying out LPA as part of the R software. More details on the statistical software developed and included in the Appendix.</p>
</div>
<div id="overall-solutions-for-all-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Overall solutions for all models</h3>
<p>First, I examined a wide range of models and solutions. I did this in order to select particular, candidate models to scrutinize in greater detail. In order to carry out this analysis, I followed guidelines recommended by the developers of MPlus (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2012; Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017) as well as those making recommendations about its use (Geiser, 2012). In particular, I set the number of starts to 600 for initial stage starts, and to 120 for the number of starts to be optimized. This means that for each model estimated, 600 random starting values for the parameters were used to initialize the EM algorithm. Of these 600, 120 that demonstrated the lowest log-likelihood were allowed to continue until they reached convergence or the limit for the number of iterations. In order for a model to me considered trustworthy, of these 120 runs, the lowest log-likelihood must be replicated at least one time.</p>
<p>If the log-likelihood is not replicated, then the estimation completed one or more times, but because the same log-likelihood value (and parameter estimates) were not obtained, then the solution can be considered to be “under-identified”, a term used to describe solutions that depend strongly upon minor fluctuations in the data (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2007). Accordingly, these solutions may not represent meaningful values and may not be replicable in light of very small changes to the data; these are not considered as candidate solutions for use in subsequent analyses. If no log-likelihood is obtained for any of the random starts, then the software returns an error; in these cases, the convergence criteria–values that determine when a solution has been obtained–are not met. This may be due to a large number of parameters that are estimated relative to the data, such that the number of iterations that the estimation is allowed to go through are not sufficient to obtain a solution (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2007). Like when the log-likelihood is not replicated, these solutions are not considered for use in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>For every combination of models one through six and from two through ten profiles, only solutions associated with model specifications 1 and 2 (and among these two solutions, only those associated with particular number of profiles) converged. Thus, only solutions associated with models 1 (the model with varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to zero) and model 2 (varying means, equal variances, and equal covariances) are explored in subsequent sections. This suggests that the more complex models were too complex given the systematic variability in the data used for the analyis.</p>

<div id="in-depth-statistics-for-particular-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> In-depth statistics for particular models</h3>
<p>After investigating the general information about a range of model solutions, solutions associated with models 1 and 2 are explored in greater detail, following recommendations associated with mixture modeling (Collins and Lanza, 2009; Geiser, 2012) and the authors of the MPlus software (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017) as well as recent peer-reviewed articles (Pastor et al., 2007). For these models, the log-likelihood (LL), a range of information criteria (AIC, BIC, sample adjusted BIC [SABIC], consistent AIC [CAIC]), statistics about the quality of the profile assignments (entropy, which represents the mean posterior probability) are presented.</p>
<p>The information criteria are based on the log-likelihood but take various steps to penalize complex models, and so can be used to directly compare models (i.e., the model with the lowest values for these statistics can be considered to better reflect the underlying properties of the profiles). Simulation studies have suggested that BIC, CAIC, SABIC, and BLRT are most helpful for selecting the correct number of profiles (Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muthen, 2007). For the entropy statistic, higher values are considered better, though scholars have suggested that the entropy statistic not be used for model selection (Lubke &amp; Muthen, 2007).The log-likelihood should not be interpreted directly but is presented in conjunction with the information criteria for context about how each of them differs from the log-likelihood. These are also presented in the figures.</p>
<p>In addition to these statistics, a number of modified likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are used, as the test statistics associated with unmodified LRT do not follow the distribution that the test is based on (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017). These are the Vu-Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT, Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT, and the bootstrapped LRT. Of the three, the bootstrapped is considered to be the best indicator of which of two models, one nested (with certain parameters fixed to 0) within the other, fits better, but it is also the most computationally-intensive to carry out (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2012). For each of the LRTs, the test statistic and its associated p-value are provided; a p-value greater than .05 suggests that the model with fewer profiles should be preferred.</p>

</div>
<p>Looking across the statistics presented, some general ideas about which models are to be preferred emerge. Solutions are interpreted first for each model individually and then across models with the goal of choosing a smaller number of models to investigate in more detail.</p>
<p>For solutions associated with model 1, the decrease (indicating a preferred model) in information criteria becomes smaller as the number of profiles increases from 5 to 6 and 6 to 7. A solution associated with 8 profiles did not replicate the log-likelihood and the VLMR and LMR suggest that the solution associated with 9 profiles did not fit better than that with 8 profiles, suggesting that models with 7 or fewer profiles be preferred. Considering these models, the entropy statistic increases by a large amount between the solution associated with 4 and 5 profiles (and then decreases slightly between 5 and 6 and 6 and 7 profile solutions), suggesting (but not providing conclusive evidence) that models 5, 6, or 7 may be preferred. The bootstrapped LRT suggests that, until the log-likelihood is not replicated, every more complex model be selected. Taking these pieces of evidence into conclusion, for model 1, solutions associated with 4 through 7 may be considered in more depth, with an emphasis on solutions associated with profiles with 5 and 6 profiles on the basis of the slowing of the decrease in the information criteria associated with the solutions with greater profiles than these, and the increase in the entropy from 4 to 5 (and 6) profile solutions.</p>
<p>For solutions associated with model 2, only those associated with 2-5 profile solutions were associated with log-likelihoods that were replicated. For these four models, the log-likelihood decreased in a mostly consistent way, such that changes in the decrease are not as evident as those associated with model 1. The entropy statistic decreases from 2 to 3 profile solutions, increases from 3 to 4 profile solutions, and then decreases slightly from 4 to 5 profile solutions, providing some information that models associated with 4 profiles be preferred to the others. All of the LRTs suggest that the more complex model be selected, not providing clear information about which solutions are to be preferred. On the basis of these pieces of evidence, models with 3, 4, and 5 solutions may be considered in more depth. However, there is a lack of consistent evidence favoring more or less complex models.</p>

<div id="comparison-of-model-1-and-model-2-type-solutions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Comparison of model 1 and model 2 type solutions</h3>
<p>When looking across solutions, some overall patterns in terms of what profiles emerge and some directions for which models are to be selected for use in subsequent analysis can be identified. First, overall patterns are discussed. In the table, which profiles emerge from which solution is presented.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of profiles. Some appear very commonly, particularly those (full and universally low) characterized by high or low levels across all of the variables. Moderate profiles, both all moderate (characterized by moderately high levels across all of the variables) and moderately low (characterized by low levels across all of the variables), also appeared commonly, particularly for the solutions for model 1.</p>

<div id="examination-of-specific-candidate-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5</span> Examination of specific candidate models</h3>
<p>In this section, specific model solutions - the model 1, six profile, and model 1 type, seven profile - solutio are described in-depth. Other candidate solutions are described in the appendix. For all of the solutions, the raw data and the data that are centered to have a mean equal to 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (thus, the y-axis on each of the plots is labeled “Z-score”).</p>
<div id="model-1-profiles-6" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5.1</span> Model: 1, Profiles: 6</h4>
<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full</strong> profile, profile 6</li>
<li>An <strong>universally low</strong> profile, profile 2</li>
<li>An <strong>all moderate</strong> profile, profile 5–and, like, the model 1, six profile solution–with moderate levels of affective engagement</li>
<li>An <strong>only behaviorally engaged</strong> profile, profile 1, with moderate levels of behavioral engagement, very low affective engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <strong>only affectively engaged</strong> profile, profile 4, with moderate levels of affective engagement, low levels of behavioral engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <strong>engaged and competent but not challenged</strong> profile, profile 3, characterized by high levels of each of the three dimensions of engagement and of competence, but with low levels of challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is somewhat balanced, with the universally low profile with the largest number of observations (<em>n</em> = 667; the same number for this profile as in the model 1, five profile solution), followed by the all moderate profile (<em>n</em> = 638). Each of the other four profiles were associated with 300 to 400 observations. Unlike the model 1, four and five profile solutions, which distinguished observations on <em>either</em> a condition of engagement (i.e., competence) or one of its dimensions (i.e., cognitive, behavioral, and affective), this solution was associated with profiles that distinguished observations on the basis of both: There were profiles for only behaviorally and affectively engaged and for engaged and competent but not challenged. This solution is compelling because it appears to group students on the basis of multiple of the indicators, and demonstrate viability on the basis of the fit statistics (i.e., the tables and figure). The log-likelihood was replicated two times, with the next lowest log-likelihood not being replicated, followed by a log-likelihood that was replicated (at least) seven times. This solution (associated with the log-likelihood that was replicated [at least] seven times) could be investigated in further detail, to see whether–and if so, how–it differs from the solution interpreted here. This solution is a strong candidate for use in subsequent analyses.</p>

</div>
<div id="model-1-profiles-7" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5.2</span> Model: 1, Profiles: 7</h4>
<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full</strong> profile, profile 7</li>
<li>A <strong>universally low</strong> profile, profile 1</li>
<li>A <strong>competent but not engaged or challenged</strong> profile, profile 2, characterized by high competence and moderate (low) or low levels of engagement and challenge</li>
<li>A <strong>moderately low</strong> profile, profile 3, characterized by moderately low levels of all of the variables</li>
<li>A <strong>challenged</strong> profile, profile 4, characterized by high challenge, moderate (high) levels of engagement, and moderate (low) levels of competence</li>
<li>A <strong>highly challenged</strong> profile, profile 5, characterized by patterns similar to those of the challenged profile, but with higher challenge and with low levels of both engagement and challenge</li>
<li>A <strong>challenged but not engaged or competent</strong> profile, profile 6, characterized by low levels of challenge, and high levels of engagement and competence</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is not very balanced, with few (<em>n</em> = 181) observations associated with the universally low profile and few (<em>n</em> = 222) observations associated with the highly challenged profile. The number of observations associated with the other profiles ranged from 317 to 651. Distinct from other solutions, none of the other five profiles were found in the other model 1 solutions. Two pairs of the profiles–challenged and highly challenged and universally low and moderately low–exhibited similar patterns among the variables that were distinguished by different mean levels. The log-likelihood was replicated twice, with the next lowest log-likelihood being replicate four times, possibly warranting further investigation. Taken together, this solution raises questions about whether it may be too complex, possibly suggesting preference for model 1 five and six profile solutions.</p>

<div id="looking-across-model-1-and-model-2-solutions" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5.3</span> Looking across model 1 and model 2 solutions</h4>
<p>The model 1, six and seven profile solutions are compelling because both show profiles that are distinguished by dimensions of engagement and its conditions (challenge and competence). Note that for this model, only the means and variances are estimated (and so no covariances are estimated), and the variances are constrained to be the same across the profiles. While this is a very restrictive model, it, along with the model 3 type (which did not lead to solutions for any of the numbers of profiles specified) also is a standard model for LPA, in that it meets the assumption of local independence (of the variables that make up the profiles–unlike for models in which covariances are estimated) typical common to LPA (see Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2016). While some of the soutions associated with the model 2 type did reach solutions, these demonstrated less appealing properties in terms of their fit statistics as well as their interpretability and with respect to concerns of parsimony. Thus, while no covariances are estiamted for the model 1 type solutions, there is no requirement that these be specified; their benefit, when models associated with them are preferred, is that they can provide better fit: they can be used to better explain or predict the data in a sample, but their inclusion also means that over-fitting the model to the data can become a greater concern.</p>
<p>For each solution, alternate solutions associated with higher log-likelihoods were explored. One advantage of the six profile solution is that most of its profiles can also be identified in solutions with fewer profiles. For the six profile solutions, this alternate solution was very different, whereas for the seven profile solutions, this alternate solution was highly similar. The model solutions exhibit a less clear pattern in terms of which profiles appear when. All else being equal, on the basis of parsimony, the model 1, six profile solution may be preferred and is selected for use in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>As a type of sensitivity analysis focused on alternate model specifications (different from the kind described earlier for quantifying how robust an inference is to potential sources of bias or confounding variables, e.g. Frank, 2003), the model 1, seven profile solution is also explored, but results for it are included in an appendix. This model is less restrictive but does not meet the assumption of independence; some scholars refer to it, as such, as a general or Guassian mixture model solution, instead of an LPA solution (Bauer, 2004). Because covariances are estimated, relationships between the variables not captured in their mean levels estimated for each profile are also estimated. This suggests that these models may be modeling different relations between the variables than those associated with model 1 and that they may fit the data better, but they are also more complex and so should be interpreted with consideration these added parameters.</p>

<div id="research-question-2-relations-between-instructional-support-for-work-with-data-and-the-pecs" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Research Question #2: Relations Between Instructional Support for Work With Data and the PECs</h2>
<p>Broadly, this question is focused on how instructional support for work with data, as coded from video-recordings of the programs, relates to the PECs. For the primary results for this question, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and youth are used and for the “nesting” of both within each of the nine programs are used. For the outcome (<em>y</em> variable), the probability of a response belonging to the profile is used; thus, there are six models, for each of the six profiles, for each specification of the predictor (<em>x</em>) variables.</p>
<p>Null models showing the proportion of variance (via the intra-class correlation) are interpreted. The more detailed results (in a table) are presented in the appendix. These are followed by the interpretation of findings related to a more variable-centered approach, namely, correlations between individual aspects of work with data and the composite and the profiles (and the variables that make them up) and individual interest. Finally, results of mixed effects models with the work with data variables added separate and then with the composite for instructional support for work with data are interpreted and presented.</p>
<div id="null-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Null models</h3>
<p>The null models presented in the table provide insight into the levels at which predictors may be able to explain the outcome. For all six profiles, the ICCs were very small, from 0.00 to 0.023. This suggests that very little variability can be explained simply by the program. For the momentary level, the ICCs were also very small, ranging from 0.004 to 0.011. Finally, the youth-level ICCs ranged from .099 to .427. Looking across these values, considering variability at the program, momentary, and youth levels, most of the explained variability in the responses is associated with youth; the program and momentary levels were associated with very small values, suggesting that variables at these levels have minimal variability that is able to be explained. In turn, this suggests that these variables, including those for instructional support for work with data, may not have strong effects in terms of their relations with the PECs.</p>
<p>In terms of specific ICCs at the youth level, the value for the youth-level ICC was highest for the full profile, suggesting that some youth have a strong tendency to be fully engaged (possibly due to their initial interest or other individual characteristics and differences). The other profile characterized by a consistent pattern across all of the variables–the universally low profile–had a modest ICC, .265. Finally, a large amount of variability is associated with the residual (variance that is not associated with the program, momentary, or youth levels). This suggests that there is wide variation in students’ responses that may not be readily explained or predicted.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Models with variables for aspects of instructional support for work with data added separately</h3>
<p>When the predictor variables for work with data are added, some overall patterns and specific findings can be identified. The only relations with <em>p</em>-values that were below the criterion for statistical significance (.05) were for the relations between modeling data and full engagement (<em>B</em> = 0.036 (0.016), <em>p</em> = .016) and between generating data and full engagement (<em>B</em> = 0.029 (0.015), <em>p</em> = .024). The effect of being female upon universally low engagement was moderate (<em>B</em> = 0.057 (0.035), p = .050).</p>
<p>Sensitivity analysis for the effect of generating data suggested that 1.883% of the inference would have to be due to bias to invalidate the inference, suggesting that this effect is not very robust to potential sources of bias, such as an omitted (in this analysis) confounding (or control) variable. For the effect of modeling, XXX% would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference.</p>

<div id="models-with-the-composite-added" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Models with the composite added</h3>
<p>For the composite of work with data, the composite predicted profile 1, only behavioral (<em>B</em> = 0.008 (0.004), <em>p</em> = .016), but not any of the other profiles. However, this coefficient is very small in practical terms, and only 1.395% would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. Being female again predicted universally low engagement (<em>B</em> = 0.057 (0.035), p = .050).</p>

<p>When looking across findings, we find very few relations between instructional support for work with data and the profiles.

Broadly, reasons for why this may be–focusing on the characteristics of instructional support for work with data in the context of summer STEM programs and how this support is measured in terms of codes from the video–are the focus on research question #5 and are discussed in the next chapter.

<p>Research question #4 is focused on how the relationships of instructional support for work with data and the activity differ on the basis of pre-program interest. Like for the previous two research questions, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and the youth–and their nesting within the programs–are used. Findings from models with pre interest, gender, and URM status are first presented. Then, models with these variable and the composite for work with data are added and then models with the interaction between these characteristics and the composite.</p>

<p>These results were also very similar to when interest was added as a control: The activity and full engagement were statistically significantly related (<em>B</em> = 0.056 (0.016), <em>p</em> &lt; .001) and between the composite and only behavioral (<em>B</em> = 0.008 (0.004), <em>p</em> = .027). Interest predicted the engaged and competent but not challenged profile (<em>B</em> = 0.037 (0.016), <em>p</em> = .008). 43.69% of the effect of activity upon full engagement would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. The effect of the composite on behavioral was not robust, with only 1.34% needing to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. The effect of interest was robust, with 13.34% needing to be due to bias to invalidate the inference.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1.0.1</span> General measurement issues</h5>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2</span> Affordances and constraints of summer STEM programs for work with data</h3>
<p>This theme concerned how summer STEM program afforded and constrained work with data.

<div id="affordances" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2.1</span> Affordances</h4>

</div>
<div id="constraints" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2.2</span> Constraints</h4>
<p>Constraints included the challenge of linking activities as a part of a complete cycle of investigation and an emphasis on outcomes other than the capacity to work with data.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2.2.1</span> Challenge of linking activities as part of a complete cycle of investigation</h5>
<p>Youth activity leaders faced challenges linking activities as part of a complete cycle of investigation.</p>
<p>One aspect of this concerned both creating and modeling data.</p>
<p>A related aspect concerned what the programs focused on. For example, the mathematics-focused programs emphasized measuring, while the science-focused programs emphasized making observations and communicating and interpreting findings. The engineering-focused programs emphasized using models, but often concrete models, rather than statistical models of data.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2.2.2</span> Emphasis on outcomes other than the capacity to work with data</h5>
<p>First, the programs emphasized outcomes such as youth’s confidence in their learning, planning skills, and ability to collaborate. These outcomes are complimentary to building youth’s ability to work with data, but at the same time, they meant that over the approximately four weeks of the program, limited time was dedicated to work with data.</p>
<p>Related, on occasion, youth demonstrated a reluctance to engage in what they perceived as “school” activities.</p>
