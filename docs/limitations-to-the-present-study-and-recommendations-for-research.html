<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 6</span> Limitations to the present study and recommendations for research</h1>
<p>This study examines youths’ engagement as an outcome. Accordingly, outcomes from engaging, such as the products of neither youths’ work or the specific cognitive capabilities they develop through their participation, are not the focus. Thus, while some findings about how work with data and youth characteristics were found to be associated with different profiles of engagement, we do not have an understanding of how engaging in more or less adaptive ways relates to these outcomes. Examining how work with data and engagement relate to key learning, motivational, and future goals and plans-related outcomes is a topic for future research.</p>
<p>It is possible that the somewhat minimal findings are, in part, a result of the analytic approach. A similar mixed effects modeling approach has only been used in one other study (Strati et al., 2017), and that approach did not use profiles (as in this study) as the outcome. In this study, little variability at the instructional episode level was found, and so minimal relations between factors at this (instructional episode) level and the profiles of engagement was expected. Might profiles, but not the variables used to create them, be less variable at the instructional episode level? One way to consider such an alternate explanation is to use the data used in this study as part of a correlational analysis, or another analysis that uses that variables used to create profiles of engagement but does not use the profiles themselves.</p>
<p>There were some general measurement-related limitations. Work with data can be difficult to measure because, as the qualitative analysis revealed, there are a variety of ways in which youth can be involved in work with data. Related,, work with data was measured as being present or not present; might a scale, that measures gradations of work with data, or a learning progression for work with data, be used as part of different measures? More specific in terms of the alignment of the measure with the conceptual framework for work with data, the dimensions of the STEM-PQA measure aligned closely with the aspects of work with data. But, there were some possible divergences that may have had an impact upon some of the findings. For example, for the interpreting and communicating findings code, the STEM-PQA codes for <em>Analyze</em> (“Staff support youth in analyzing data to draw conclusions”) and <em>Use symbols or models</em> (“Staff support youth in conveying STEM concepts through symbols, models, or other nonverbal language”) were used. In the case of the latter STEM-PQA code, conveying STEM concepts through symbols, models, or other nonverbal language could have reflected instructional episodes in which youth used, for example, mathematical equations or formulas, but did not do so as part of modeling data of a phenomena in the world: They could have simply been using an equation outside of the context of any particular phenomena. Future research may consider use of coding for this aspect of work with data (and this aspect of science curricular standards in particular; see NGSS Lead States, 2013).</p>
<p>As another example of this limitation, generating data was an aspect of work with data that the open-ended qualitative analysis revealed to be less associated with less systematic groups of practices, or themes, than the other aspects. The STEM-PQA codes corresponding to this aspect of work with data were <em>Collect data or measure</em> (“Staff support youth in collecting data or measuring”) and <em>Highlight precision and accuracy</em> (“Staff highlight value of precision and accuracy in measuring, observing, recording, or calculating”). Particularly in the case of the latter code, the emphasis on precision and accuracy may have been outside of activities focused on recording data or creating coding frames. Future research may consider a coding frame that is (even more) focused on generating data, though considerations of precision and accuracy are key aspects of doing so, and so perhaps separating the act of generating data from considerations that are important to keep in mind while doing it may be a promising direction for future research.</p>
<p>While these divergences in measures were not large, they suggest that the coding frame for work with data is a limitation of the present study. McNeill and Berland (2017) describe a similar type of disagreement across science education settings: While a limitation, the coding frame did represent agreement across a range of studies across STEM contexts for the aspects of work with data, although I recognize that this coding frame may not distinguish the different ways in which work with data is enacted, as revealed by the qualitative coding carried out in this study.</p>
<!-- [fix me! need to think about how these fit] -->
<!-- In other instances, youth were involved in observing phenomena, but were not ever asked to use those data in subsequent activities or through engaging in other aspects of work with data. For example, the science-focused programs (*Island Explorers*, *The Ecosphere*, and *Marine Investigators*) all emphasized making observations, but these observations were not frequently written down or entered into a spreadsheet as data. For example, in *Marine Investigators*, youth observed how the Atlantic Ocean brings salt water into the (freshwater) bay. Youth observe "buffers" between the salt and freshwater, but do not collect or otherwise generate data related to their observations. In these cases, the observations were less systematic. This occurred [x] of the time. -->
<!-- During some of these cases, youth generated data, but they did not use the data they generated in subsequent activities. In the engineering-focused programs (*Uptown Architecture*, *Crazy Machines*, and *Dorchester House* particularly, youth often generated data that resulted from their engineering designs (and communicated and interpreted their findings,) but did not model this data as a regular part of their activities. In one particular example, in the *Ecosphere* program, youth collected water samples in the field. They then brought these samples to the classroom and tested the water, involving youth in both collecting and, to a degree, generating data (by noting the pH levels of the water). However, later in the day, youth created a small-scale model (with inclined trays of dirt, rocks, and plants) of an ecosystem, in which they added food coloring to determine the impacts of chemicals and acid rain. Youth then interpreted and discussed these findings, but did not connect the discussion to the water samples youth collected and tested earlier. While these specimens were collected to serve as data for a future activity, there was no recording observed during the episode.  -->
<p>One factor of note concerns the analytic approach used. As noted, the profiles demonstrated very little variability at the program and instructional episode level, suggesting that factors at this level would likely not strongly predict the profiles. This could be a function of the use of profiles and the specific variables selected. It may also be the result of the outcome (engagement and its conditions) selected. Other analytic approaches can be carried out to determine the viability of the profiles approach and use of the items for engagement and its conditions for understanding work with data.</p>
<p>While these are important limitations, it is worth noting that the modeling strategy (with the mixed effects models) is inherently a conservative (particularly in terms of the statistical significance of hypothesis tests) approach. Thus, while the findings detected are small, they can be considered to be trustworthy on the basis of the way the ESM data were analyzed. This trustworthiness is enhanced by the use of sensitivity analysis, which showed how much of the effects could be due to bias for them to be invalidated.</p>
<p>For example, as McNeill and Berland (2017) argue, it is not just engaging in these practices by rote, but about integrating them, as they overlap and interconnect.They argue that a view of work with data focused on sense-making with real-world phenomena and iterative cycles of engaging in work with data, and revision of intermediate ideas.</p>
