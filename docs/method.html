<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Method</h1>
<p>In recognition of the challenge of studying engagement in learning environments where factors related to activities, learners, and each of the nine programs all interact at the same time, this study uses a methodological approach suited to studying engagement as a dynamic, multi-faceted experience. Specifically, this study employs the Experience Sampling Method (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2007) where learners answer short questions about their experience when signaled. This approach is both sensitive to changes in engagement over time, as well as between learners and allows us to understand engagement and how factors impact it in more nuanced and complex ways (Turner &amp; Meyer, 2000).</p>
<div id="participants" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Participants</h2>
<p>Participants consist of 203 youth. Youth in these programs are from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (see Table 1). Most participants are around 13 years old (from youth whose age was available: <em>M</em> = 12.71, <em>SD</em> = 1.70, <em>min.</em> = 10.75, <em>max.</em> = 16.36). Detailed demographic characteristics of learners are presented in the table.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Context</h2>
<p>The setting for this study is nine out-of-school STEM programs designed around best practices in urban areas in the Northeast United States during the summer of 2015. These are described in the appendix with pseudonyms for the program names. Two intermediary organizations contracted by the urban area school districts to administer the summer programs. The two intermediaries were responsible for soliciting and enrolling youth; establishing guidelines for the design of the programs, and the goals of the programs; and provide training and professional development for the program’s staff. A key difference between the intermediary organizations was that one separated academic and enrichment-related activities, whereas, in another, which was more closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the program, the academic and enrichment components were more integrated, which may have program-specific effects on learners’ engagement. Many of the programs aim to involve learners in work with data. These learning environments bring together youth activity leaders, educators, and those with technical expertise in STEM domains. Youth spent around three hours per day for four days per week for the approximately four-week programs, which were taught by youth activity leaders and scientists, engineers, and other community members with technical expertise.</p>
</div>
<div id="procedure" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Procedure</h2>
<p>Youth completed a pre-survey before the program. Youth also completed pre-course surveys of their experience in STEM, intention to pursue a STEM major or career, and questions for other motivation and engagement-related measures. At the beginning of the programs, youth were introduced to the study and the phones used for data collection related to the ESM. ESM data were collected two days each week, for three weeks (weeks 2-4 of the program). In all of the programs, about equal video-recording time was dedicated to classroom and field experiences. This detail is important because programs associated with one of the intermediaries rotated between classroom and field experience days, while the other used the first half of each day for one (i.e., classroom activities) or the other (i.e., field experience days).</p>
<p>Each day, youth were signaled four times. These signals were at the same time for all of the youth within their program, but at different times between programs and between days within programs (with the constraint that no two signals could occur less than ten minutes apart). All of the programs were video-recorded by research team members and on three occasions research team members also recorded detailed field notes on the nature of program activities. So that measures corresponding to the video and ESM data can be matched, videos include a signal from the video-recorder identifying the ESM signal to which youth responded at that point in the video.</p>
<p>In a reflection of the dynamic conceptualization of engagement, this study uses data collected from ESM. As such, learners are prompted at regular intervals to respond to short questions about their perceptions of their engagement and its influencers. Though time-consuming to carry out, ESM can be a powerful measure that leverages the benefits of both observational and self-report measures, allowing for some ecological validity and the use of closed-form questionnaires amenable to quantitative analysis (Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson, 1987). Despite the logistic challenge of carrying out ESM in large studies, some scholars have referred to it as the “gold standard” for understanding individual’s subjective experience (Schwarz, Kahneman, &amp; Xu, 2009). This approach has the benefit of measuring learners’ engagement at a fine grain-size: Changes in the activity on learners’ engagement, even within the same session of the program, and changes in how influencers of engagement impact engagement and how the activity may relate to engagement, can be measured.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-sources-and-measures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Data Sources and Measures</h2>
<p>Data sources consist of self-reported ESM measures of engagement and learners’ perceptions of themselves and the activity, pre-survey measures of youths’ interest, youths’ demographic information, and video-recordings of programs.</p>
<div id="esm-measures-of-learners-engagement-and-its-conditions-for-the-profiles" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> ESM measures of learners’ engagement and its conditions for the profiles</h3>
<p>Measures for engagement and its conditions were constructed from three ESM responses for engagement and two ESM responses for the conditions of engagement. The three variables for engagement are for learning (for the cognitive engagement construct), working hard (for behavioral engagement), and enjoying (for affective engagement). The variables for the conditions are for perceived challenge and perceived competence. All five items are used to construct profiles. Each of the ESM items consisted of the item text and the following four item response options, of which youth were directed to select one: Not at all (associated with the number 1 on the survey), A little (2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much (4), as presented in Table 3.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Survey measures of pre-interest</h3>
<p>Measures of youths’ pre-interest are used as youth-level influencers of the profiles. In particular, three items adapted from Vandell, Hall, O’Cadiz, and Karsh (2012) were used, with directions for youth to rate their agreement with the items’ text using the same scale as the ESM items: Not at all (associated with the number 1 on the survey), A little (2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much (4). The measure was constructed by taking the maximum value for the scales for the different content areas (science, mathematics, and engineering), so that the value for a youth whose response for the science scale was 2.5 and for the mathematics scale was 2.75 would be 2.5. The items are presented in Table 4.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Codes from video-recordings for work with data</h3>
<p>Different aspects of work with data are identified from video-recordings with the use of a coding frame with five for each of the aspects of work with data. These codes are developed from the STEM-Program Quality Assessment (STEM-PQA; Forum for Youth Investment, 2012), an assessment of quality programming in after school programs. For the PQA, raters contracted by American Institute of Research (AIR) were trained in the use of the PQA measure during February, 2017. Raters completed a four-hour online training module on the overall PQA tool and then attended an in-person two-day training led by a trainer from the David P. Weikart Center for Youth Program Quality, the tool’s publisher, where they learned about the instrument, trained on its use, and then established inter-rater reliability with a master coder. For the STEM-PQA, three of the same raters contracted by AIR to overall PQA measure used the STEM-PQA scored one video segment, for which there were no disagreements on scoring across the four raters on any items. If any of the raters encountered into a situation that was difficult to score, they would all discuss the issue by telephone or more often by email after viewing the video in question and reach a consensus on how to score the specific item. Programs were divided up among all of the raters, so raters coded some of the videos for all of the programs.</p>
<p>Specific details on how the measure aligns with the original STEM-PQA on which this measure is based are presented in the appendix.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Analysis for Research Question #1 (on the frequency and nature of work with data)</h3>
<p>First, the frequency of the codes for the individual aspects of work with data from the PQA measure of work with data (described above), and the composite for work with data, which was simply the sum of the codes for the individual aspects of work with data, are calculated. Then, to present a qualitative description, all of the segments were coded, moments associated with specific codes were identified and used to provide examples for each of the aspects of work with data.</p>
<p>To code the data, three research assistants were trained for approximately eight hours over four meetings. Then, each research assistant coded all of the segments associated with one of the videos. The guiding questions for the qualitative coding were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are youth doing?</li>
<li>When asking questions or defining problems is coded, what, if any are the questions or problems? Who is asking the question (i.e teacher or student)</li>
<li>When making observations is coded, what are youth doing?</li>
<li>When generating data is coded, how, if they are, are youth collecting or recording data?</li>
<li>When analyzing or modeling data is coded, what analysis are they doing, or what models are they using? Are they talking about variability or uncertainty? If so, how?</li>
<li>When interpreting and communicating findings is coded, what are youth interpreting or how are they communicating?</li>
<li>Is there a phenomena being studied or a problem being investigated? If so, what is the phenomena being studied or problem being investigated?</li>
<li>Is the activity related to something youth have previously done or learned about? If so, how?</li>
<li>Is the activity related to something youth will do or will learn about? If so, how?</li>
<li>Is the activity collaborative? If so, what is happening?</li>
<li>Is anything else of interest or that is noteworthy going on?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the coding was complete, the three research assistants and I met to discuss how well the coding frame and potential sources of disagreement. Then, two coders coded every segment that was coded for at least one of the aspects of work with data. This coding took around 75 hours of coding by the research assistants. After coding all of the segments associated with each program, the coders met to discuss potential issues that emerged throughout the coding, and to clarify how they applied the coding frame.</p>
<p>I then read through all of the codes for all of the segments, and made notes associated with each of the five aspects of work with data (i.e., asking questions, making observations, and the other aspects). These notes focused on whether and in what ways there appeared to be alignment between the codes for work with data (from the PQA) and the conceptual framework for work with data. I used these notes to write detailed descriptions of each of the aspects of work with data. I also calculated how many time these aligned (i.e., how many times both the PQA code for an aspect of work with data was supported by the qualitative code) for each aspect of work with data.</p>

<div id="background-information-on-latent-profile-analysis-lpa" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.5.3.1</span> Background information on Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)</h4>
<p>LPA can be used to identify common patterns in learners’ ESM responses as part of a person-oriented analysis to construct the profiles. These profiles make it possible to analyze the multivariate data collected on engagement in a way that balances the parsimony of a single model for all learners with a recognition of individual differences in how learners’ experience each of the dimensions of engagement together at the same time. A key benefit of the use of LPA, in addition to likelihood estimation-based fit indices, is probabilities of an observation being a member of a cluster (unlike in cluster analysis). LPA also provides <em>probabilities</em> of an observation being in a particular profile, unlike cluster analysis, which involves exclusively classifying an observation into one profile.</p>
<p>This question addresses what profiles emerged from the ESM responses for cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and perceptions of challenge and competence. To answer this question, profiles are constructed with the five self-reported ESM measures for cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and perceptions of challenge and competence. Once this step is carried out, the probability of a response being associated with a profile of engagement and its conditions are used as the dependent variable for subsequent analyses. Answers to this question will help to understand how the aspects of engagement relate to both one another and to key conditions that influence engagement.</p>
<p>To create the profiles, a mixture modeling approach is carried out. Mixture modeling is an approach for identifying distinct distributions, or mixtures of distributions, of measured variables. A type of mixture modeling within a latent variable modeling framework, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA; Harring &amp; Hodis, 2016; Muthen, 2004) is used in this study. LPA allows for capturing the multidimensional nature of engagement and its conditions, as is the goal of the analysis for the present study.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.5.3.2</span> Selecting a model on the basis of fit indices and other techniques</h4>
<p>As part of LPA, different models that determine whether and how different parameters (i.e., means, variances, and covariances) are estimated. In addition, the number of profiles to estimate must be provided by the analyst. Determining the number of profiles depends on fit statistics (such as information criteria and the entropy statistic) as well as concerns of parsimony and interpretability. In general, the approach to choosing the model is similar to choosing the number of profiles, requiring deciding on the basis of evidence from multiple sources. The models are described in-depth in the appendix. The number of profiles are determined on the basis of the log-likelihood and bootstrapped likelihood ratio test, entropy, Akaike Information Criteria, and Bayesian Information Criteria statistics, as well as concerns of parsimony and interpretability.</p>
<p>First, I examined a wide range of model types (i.e., the parameterization of the model, with the six options described in the appendix as candidates) and the numbers of profiles. These roughly became more complex, with additional parameters estimated, as the number for the model type increases from one to six. This step is taken to select candidate solutions to investigate in more detail. In order to carry out this analysis, I followed guidelines recommended by the developers of the MPlus software (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2012; Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017) as well as those making recommendations about its use (Geiser, 2012).</p>
<p>To select a model for use in subsequent analyses, the log-likelihood (LL), a range of information criteria (AIC, BIC, sample adjusted BIC [SABIC], consistent AIC [CAIC]), statistics about the quality of the profile assignments (entropy, which represents the mean posterior probability), statistical tests (Vu-Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT [VLMR], Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT [LMR], and the bootstrapped LRT [BLRT]), and concerns of interpretability and parsimony are used. Past research suggests that BIC, CAIC, SABIC, and BLRT are most helpful for selecting the correct number of profiles (Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muthen, 2007). For the entropy statistic, higher values are considered better, though scholars have suggested that the entropy statistic not be used for model selection (Lubke &amp; Muthen, 2007). Of the three statistical tests, the bootstrapped is considered to be the best indicator of which of two models, one nested (with certain parameters fixed to 0) within the other, fits better, but it is also the most computationally-intensive to carry out (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2012).</p>

<div id="analysis-for-research-question-3-how-work-with-data-relates-to-engagement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.5</span> Analysis for Research Question #3 (how work with data relates to engagement)</h3>
<p>Broadly, this question is focused on how work with data, as coded from video-recordings of the programs, relates to the profiles. For the primary results for this question, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and youth are used and for the “nesting” of both within each of the nine programs are used. For the outcome (<em>y</em> variable), the probability of a response belonging to the profile is used; thus, there are six models, for each of the six profiles, for each specification of the predictor (<em>x</em>) variables.</p>
<p>To answer this question, on how well the aspects of work with data predict the profiles, first, indicators for activities coded for any of the five aspects of work with data and either of the other two activities are used to predict each PEC. The <em>lme4</em> R package (Bates, Martin, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015) is used. All of the models for this and research question #4 use random effects for learner, momentary, and program effects. Learner and moment can be considered to be crossed with both nested within the program. Because the outcome from LPA is not a hard classification (i.e., an observation is in a profile—or not) but a probability, the outcome is treated as a continuous variable. First, null models with only the random parts (i.e., random learner, momentary, and program effects) are specified. Then, the predictors are added to the model with the main effects of the variables added. Lastly, a model with the work with data composite (constructed as a sum of the values of the variables for the aspects of work with data) is specified.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.6</span> Analysis for Research Question #4 (how youth characteristics relate to engagement)</h3>
<p>Research question #4 is focused on how the relationships of work with data differ on the basis of pre-program interest and other youth characteristics–their gender and URM status. Like for the previous two research questions, models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and the youth are used. Findings from models with pre interest, gender, and URM status are first carried out. Then, models with these variable and the individual aspects and composite of work with data are added and then models with the interaction between these characteristics and the composite.</p>

<div id="sensitivity-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
<p>For observational studies, such as the present study, it can be important to determine how robust an inference is to alternative explanations. One approach to addressing this is sensitivity analysis, which involves quantifying the amount of bias that would be needed to invalidate an inference (hypothetically, this bias might be due to omitted or confounding variables, measurement, missing data, etc.). Using the approach described in Frank, Maroulis, Duong, and Kelcey (2013), I carried out sensitivity analysis for inferences we made relative to our key findings. I used the R package konfound (Rosenberg, Xu, &amp; Frank, 2018). The result, and what is used to interpret and contextualize findings, is a numeric value for each effect that indicates the proportion of the estimate that would have to be biased in order to invalidate the inference: higher values indicate more robust estimates in that the inferences would still hold even if there were substantial bias in the estimate.</p>
