<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Context</h2>
<p>The setting for this study is nine out-of-school STEM programs designed around best practices in urban areas in the Northeast United States during the summer of 2015. These are described in the appendix with pseudonyms for the program names. Two intermediary organizations contracted by the urban area school districts to administer the summer programs. The two intermediaries were responsible for soliciting and enrolling youth; establishing guidelines for the design of the programs, and the goals of the programs; and provide training and professional development for the program’s staff. A key difference between the intermediary organizations was that one separated academic and enrichment-related activities, whereas, in another, which was more closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the program, the academic and enrichment components were more integrated, which may have program-specific effects on youths’ engagement. Many of the programs aim to involve youth in work with data. These learning environments bring together youth activity leaders, educators, and those with technical expertise in STEM domains. Youth spent around three hours per day for four days per week for the approximately four-week programs, which were taught by youth activity leaders and scientists, engineers, and other community members with technical expertise.</p>

<div id="participants" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Participants</h2>
<p>Participants consist of 203 youth. Youth in these programs are from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (see Table 1). Most participants are around 13 years old (from youth whose age was available: <em>M</em> = 12.71, <em>SD</em> = 1.70, <em>min.</em> = 10.75, <em>max.</em> = 16.36).

<div id="procedure" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Procedure</h2>
<p>Youth completed a pre-survey before the program including questions about their experience in STEM, intention to pursue a STEM major or career, and questions for other motivation and engagement-related measures. At the beginning of the programs, youth were introduced to the study and the phones used for data collection related to the ESM. As indicated in the earlier section, ESM is a method of data collection that involves asking (signalling) youth to respond to short questions on phones that they were provided. Youth are signaled at random times (within intervals, so that the signals were not too near or far apart) in order to obtain a sample of youths’ experiences throughout the program. ESM data were collected two days each week, for three weeks (weeks 2-4 of the program). In all of the programs, about equal video-recording time was dedicated to classroom and field experiences. This detail is important because programs associated with one of the intermediaries rotated between classroom and field experience days, while the other used the first half of each day for one (i.e., classroom activities) or the other (i.e., field experience days).</p>
<p>Each day, youth were signaled four times. These signals were at the same time for all of the youth within their program, but at different times between programs and between days within programs (with the constraint that no two signals could occur less than ten minutes apart). All of the programs were video-recorded by research team members. So that measures corresponding to the video and ESM data can be matched, videos include a signal from the video-recorder identifying the ESM signal to which youth responded at that point in the video.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-sources-and-measures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Data Sources and Measures</h2>
<p>Data sources consist of self-reported ESM measures of engagement and youths’ perceptions of themselves and the activity, pre-survey measures of youths’ interest, youths’ demographic information, and video-recordings of programs.</p>
<div id="esm-measures-of-youths-engagement-and-its-conditions-for-the-profiles" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> ESM measures of youths’ engagement and its conditions for the profiles</h3>
<p>Measures for engagement and its conditions were constructed from three ESM responses for engagement and two ESM responses for the conditions of engagement. The three variables for engagement are for learning (for the cognitive engagement construct), working hard (for behavioral engagement), and enjoying (for affective engagement). The variables for the conditions are for perceived challenge and perceived competence. All five items are used to construct profiles. Each of the ESM items consisted of the item text and the following four item response options, of which youth were directed to select one: Not at all (associated with the number 1 on the survey), A little (2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much (4), as presented in Table 3.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Survey measures of pre-interest</h3>
<p>Measures of youths’ pre-interest are used as youth-level influencers of the profiles. In particular, three items adapted from Vandell, Hall, O’Cadiz, and Karsh (2012) were used, with directions for youth to rate their agreement with the items’ text using the same scale as the ESM items: Not at all (associated with the number 1 on the survey), A little (2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much (4). The measure was constructed by taking the maximum value for the scales for the different content areas (science, mathematics, and engineering), so that the value for a youth whose response for the science scale was 2.5 and for the mathematics scale was 2.75 would be 2.5. The items are presented in Table 2.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Codes from video-recordings for work with data</h3>
<p>Different aspects of work with data are identified from video-recordings. Specifically, codes for work with data were generated on the basis of the activity that the youth activity leaders were facilitating. The activity youth activity leaders were facilitating were from the STEM-Program Quality Assessment (STEM-PQA; Forum for Youth Investment, 2012), an assessment of quality programming in after school programs. I then identified the specific activities that corresponded to the five aspects of work with data, as defined in table 4. Details on how the measure aligns with the original STEM-PQA on which this measure is based are presented in the appendix. Note that these codes were unique to each signal to which youth responded (but were not unique to each youth, as youth in the same program were signaled at the same time). I will discuss limitations to use of the STEM-PQA for work with data in the discussion.</p>

<p>In February, 2017, raters contracted by American Institute of Research (AIR) were trained in the use of the Program Quality Assessment tool (PQA)–the broader assessment tool for which the STEM-PQA is a supplement. Raters completed a four-hour online training module on the overall PQA tool and then attended an in-person two-day training led by a trainer from the David P. Weikart Center for Youth Program Quality, the tool’s publisher, where they learned about the instrument, trained on its use, and then established inter-rater reliability with a master coder.</p>
<p>For the STEM-PQA, three of the same raters contracted by AIR to code the (overall) PQA measure used the STEM-PQA supplement to score one video segment, for which there were no disagreements on scoring for any of the items. The programs were divided up among all of the raters, so raters coded some of the videos for all of the programs. When the raters encountered a situation that was difficult to score, they would all discuss the issue by telephone or more often by email after viewing the video in question and reach a consensus on how to score the specific item.</p>

<p>In addition to the measures described in this section, demographic information for youths’ gender and their racial and ethnic group are used to construct demographic variables for gender and membership in an under-represented (in STEM) group; membership in an under-represented group are identified on the basis of youths’ racial and ethnic group being Hispanic, African American, Asian or Pacific Islanders, or native American.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Analysis for Research Question #1 (on the frequency and nature of work with data)</h3>
<p>There are two primary steps taken to answer this question, one more quantitative in nature and one more qualitative.</p>
<p>Specifically, first, the frequency of the codes for the individual aspects of work with data from the STEM PQA measure of work with data (described above in the measures) are calculated. Note that this coding frame focused on the degree of instructional support the activity leaders provided for youth to work with data. However, this framework provided no context on how particular types of work with data were enacted. So, to provide more context in the description of how work with data in the context of summer STEM programs, all of the segments were coded using an open-ended, qualitative approach. To qualitatively code the data, three research assistants were trained for approximately eight hours over four meetings. Then, each research assistant coded all of the segments associated with one of the videos. The guiding questions for the qualitative coding were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When asking questions or defining problems is coded, what, if any are the questions or problems? Who is asking the question (i.e teacher or student)</li>
<li>When making observations is coded, what are youth doing?</li>
<li>When generating data is coded, how, if they are, are youth collecting or recording data?</li>
<li>When analyzing or modeling data is coded, what analysis are they doing, or what models are they using? Are they talking about variability or uncertainty? If so, how?</li>
<li>When interpreting and communicating findings is coded, what are youth interpreting or how are they communicating?</li>
</ul>
<p>Two coders coded every segment. This coding took around 75 hours of coding by the research assistants. After coding all of the segments for each program, the coders and I met to discuss potential issues that emerged throughout the coding, and to clarify how they applied the coding frame (so the coders and I met nine times during the process to discuss the coding). I then read through all of the codes for all of the segments, and made notes associated with each of the five aspects of work with data (i.e., asking questions, making observations, and the other aspects). These notes focused on whether and in what ways there appeared to be alignment between the codes for work with data (from the PQA) and the conceptual framework for work with data. I used these notes to write detailed descriptions of each of the aspects of work with data.</p>

<div id="analysis-for-research-question-2-what-profiles-of-engagement-emerge" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.3</span> Analysis for Research Question #2 (what profiles of engagement emerge)</h3>
<p>To answer this question, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA; Harring &amp; Hodis, 2016; Muthen, 2004) is used. LPA allows for capturing the multidimensional nature of engagement through profiles. A key benefit of the use of LPA, in addition to likelihood estimation-based fit indices, is probabilities of an observation being a member of a cluster (unlike in cluster analysis). These profiles make it possible to analyze the multivariate data collected on engagement in a way that balances the parsimony of a single model.</p>
<p>For these models, five variables were included: the three measures of engagement (cognitive, behavioral, and affective) and the two conditions for engagement (perceptions of challenge and competence).</p>
<p>As part of LPA, model selection–in terms of which model type is used and how many profiles are identified–is a key topic. For the present study, six models were considered:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to 0 (model one type)</li>
<li>Varying means, equal variances, and equal covariances (model two type)</li>
<li>Varying means, varying variances, and covariances fixed to 0 (model three type)</li>
<li>Varying means, varying variances, and equal covariances (model four type)</li>
<li>Varying means, equal variances, and varying covariances (model five type)</li>
<li>Varying means, varying variances, and varying covariances (model six type)</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, solutions with between two and 10 profiles were considered.</p>
<p>The MPlus software (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 1998-2017) is used to carry out LPA as part of this study. In order to more flexibly carry out LPA, an open-source tool, tidyLPA (Rosenberg, Schmidt, &amp; Beymer, 2018), was developed. This tool provides interfaces to both the MPlus software and to the open-source mclust software. In addition to being used as part of this study, this package is provided free of use to other analysts as the first tool dedicated to carrying out LPA as part of the R software. More details on the statistical software developed and included in the Appendix.</p>
<p>To select a solution in terms of the model type and the number of profiles to be interpreted and used in subsequent analyses, a number of fit statistics and other considerations are taken into account. These include a range of information criteria (AIC, BIC, sample adjusted BIC [SABIC], consistent AIC [CAIC]), statistics about the quality of the profile assignments (entropy, which represents the mean posterior probability), statistical tests (Vu-Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT [VLMR], Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT [LMR], and the bootstrapped LRT [BLRT]), and concerns of interpretability and parsimony are used. As described in more detail in the section of the results pertaining to this question, on the basis of these criteria, the model one type, six profiles solution is selected and used as part of subsequent analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis-for-research-question-3-how-work-with-data-relates-to-engagement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.4</span> Analysis for Research Question #3 (how work with data relates to engagement)</h3>
<p>Broadly, this question is focused on how work with data as coded from video-recordings of the programs, relates to the profiles. For the primary results for this question, mixed effects models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and youth are used and for the “nesting” of both within each of the nine programs are used. The <em>lme4</em> R package (Bates, Martin, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015) is used. All of the models for this and research question #4 use random effects for youth, instructional episode, and program effects. Youth and instructional episode can be considered to be crossed with both nested within the program.</p>
<p>The probability of a response belonging to the profile is the dependent variable and the aspects of work with data are the independent variable. There are six models, for each of the six profiles. Because the outcome from LPA is not a hard classification (i.e., an observation is in a profile—or not) but a probability, the dependent variable is treated as a continuous variable.</p>
<p>First, null models with only the random parts (i.e., random youth, instructional episode, and program effects) are specified. Then, the five aspects of work with data are added as predictors to the model. The results will be interpreted on the basis of which of the statistical significance and the magnitude and direction of the coefficients associated with these five predictors. For example, if the coefficient for the effect of the asking questions aspect of work with data upon one of the profiles is 0.10, and is determined to be statistically significant, then this would indicate that when youth are engaged in this aspect of work with data, then they are ten percentage points more likely to report a response in a particular profile.</p>
<p>Because the results were found to be identical when the aspects of work with data and the youth characteristics are considered in separate and in the same model, the results from the two sets of variables being in the same model are used for both to provide answers to both this and the next research question. Note that a composite for work with data (made as the sum of the individual aspects of work with data) was considered, but as it did only yielded one (small) statistically significant result, the results for this analysis are not presented in the results.</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis-for-research-question-4-how-youth-characteristics-relate-to-engagement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.5</span> Analysis for Research Question #4 (how youth characteristics relate to engagement)</h3>
<p>Research question #4 is focused on how the relationships of work with data differ on the basis of youth characteristics–their pre-program interest, gender and URM status. Like for the previous research question, models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and the youth are used. The dependent variable is again the probability of a response being in the profile. The three youth characteristics (pre-program interest in STEM, gender (entered s a dummy code with the value of “1” indicating female), and URM status (also entered as a dummy code, with “1” indicating a youth from a URM group) are added as predictors. Like for the previous research question, the statistical significance and the magnitude and direction of the coefficients associated with each predictor are interpreted to answer this question. For example, and similar to the interpretation of the predictors associated with RQ #3, if the relationship between pre-program interest and a profile is 0.05, then for each one-unit increase in pre-program interest, then youth are are five percentage points more likely to report a response in a particular profile.</p>
<p>As described in the previous sub-section, because the results were very similar when the aspects of work with data and the youth characteristics were added in <em>separate</em> models compared to when they were included in the same model, the results for both sets of predictors in the same model are presented and interpreted. In addition, interactions between statistically significant aspects of work with data and all of the youth characteristics are examined, though because none of these interactions were found to be statistically significant, they are not included with the results.</p>

<div id="sensitivity-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
<p>For observational studies, such as the present study, it can be important to determine how robust an inference is to alternative explanations. One approach to addressing this is sensitivity analysis, which involves quantifying the amount of bias that would be needed to invalidate an inference. Using the approach described in Frank, Maroulis, Duong, and Kelcey (2013), I carried out sensitivity analysis for inferences made relative to key findings. I used the R package konfound (Rosenberg, Xu, &amp; Frank, 2018). The result, and what is used to interpret and contextualize findings, is a numeric value for each effect that indicates the proportion of the estimate that would have to be biased in order to invalidate the inference. I use these to interpret and contextualize the statistically significant findings. Higher values indicate more robust estimates in that the inferences would still hold even if there were substantial bias in the estimate and that are interpreted as robust findings, while lower values, when present, indicate less robust findings that I interpret with more caution.</p>
