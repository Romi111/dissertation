<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> Method</h1>
<p>This is a causal comparative study, in that explanations for differences in PECs are sought after their occurrence. This study uses ESM (Hektner et al., 2007) data collected as part of a study of learners’ interest and engagement in outside-of-school STEM enrichment programs (Shumow &amp; Schmidt, 2013). It makes use of a sequential exploratory data analysis strategy, in which qualitative data is analyzed to enrich quantitative findings (Creswell, Clark, Gutmann, &amp; Hanson, 2003). In particular, moments in which learners are particularly engaged are identified as part of the quantitative analysis; these moments are then coded qualitatively to identify their common characteristics, first through an inductive step and then through a confirmatory step involving a second rater. While programs have been video-recorded, the video has not been coded for the aspects of work with data, and the other measures from ESM and pre-survey data are to be constructed for this study.</p>

<p>Two intermediary organizations contracted by the urban area school districts to administer the summer programs. The two intermediaries were responsible for soliciting and enrolling youth; establishing guidelines for the design of the programs, and the goals of the programs; and provide training and professional development for the program’s staff. A key difference between the intermediary organizations was that one separated academic and enrichment-related activities, whereas, in another, which was more closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the program, the academic and enrichment components were more integrated, which may have program-specific effects on learners’ engagement. Many of the programs aim to involve learners in work with data. These learning environments bring together youth activity leaders, educators, and those with technical expertise in STEM domains. Students spent around three hours per day for four days per week for the approximately four-week programs, which were taught by youth activity leaders and scientists, engineers, and other community members with technical expertise.</p>

<div id="procedure" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Procedure</h2>
<p>Students completed a pre-survey before the program. Students also completed pre- and post-course surveys of their experience in STEM, intention to pursue a STEM major or career, and questions for other motivation and engagement-related measures. At the beginning of the programs, students were introduced to the study and the phones used for data collection related to the ESM. ESM data were collected two days each week, for three weeks (weeks 2-4 of the program). In all of the programs, about equal video-recording time was dedicated to classroom and field experiences. This detail is important because programs associated with one of the intermediaries rotated between classroom and field experience days, while the other used the first half of each day for one (i.e., classroom activities) or the other (i.e., field experience days).</p>
<p>Each day, students were signaled four times. These signals were at the same time for all of the students within their program, but at different times between programs and between days within programs (with the constraint that no two signals could occur less than ten minutes apart). All of the programs were video-recorded by research team members and on three occasions research team members who recorded detailed field notes on the nature of program activities. So that measures corresponding to the video and ESM data can be matched, videos include a signal from the video-recorder identifying the ESM signal to which students responded at that point in the video.</p>
<p>In a reflection of the dynamic conceptualization of engagement, this study uses data collected from ESM. As such, learners are prompted at regular intervals to respond to short questions about their perceptions of their engagement and its influencers. Though time-consuming to carry out, ESM can be a powerful measure that leverages the benefits of both observational and self-report measures, allowing for some ecological validity and the use of closed-form questionnaires amenable to quantitative analysis (Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson, 1987). Despite the logistic challenge of carrying out ESM in large studies, some scholars have referred to it as the “gold standard” for understanding individual’s subjective experience (Schwarz, Kahneman, &amp; Xu, 2009). This approach has the benefit of measuring learners’ engagement at a fine grain-size: Changes in the activity on learners’ engagement, even within the same session of the program, and changes in how influencers of engagement impact engagement and how the activity may relate to engagement, can be measured.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Codes for instructional support for work with data from the video-recordings</h3>
<p>Different aspects of instructional support for work with data will be identified from video-recordings with the use of a coding frame with five for each of the aspects of work with data and the remaining two codes are for other instructional activities, such as listening to a youth activity leader or completing a worksheet, in order to compare work with data to other activities which are potentially engaging but not oriented toward work with data, and one for other activities, such as traveling between program sites or the time in between activities. These codes are summarized in Table 5.</p>
<!-- Revised Proposed Plan -->
<!-- ●  First, use video codes for Work With Data in place of the coding frame I developed from the STEM-Program Quality Assessment (STEM-PQA; Forum for Youth Investment, 2012), an assessment of quality programming in after school programs  -->
<!-- ○  This coding frame aligns closely with the original coding frame for Work With Data that I proposed, particularly the codes for STEM Skill-building, although there are some differences (described in the table at the end of this document) -->
<!-- ○  Each segment is coded with a 1 (present) or 0 (not present) for each of the codes for STEM Skill-building. -->
<!-- ○  The STEM-PQA instrument was adapted from the overall PQA instrument (see Smith et al., 2012). In particular: -->
<!-- ■  The items for STEM skill-building (and another set of codes for self-transcendent-goals) were added to the PQA -->
<!-- ■  A dichotomous scoring approach (observed or not observed) was used -->
<!-- ○  Reliability of the raters' use of the overall PQA instrument and the STEM-PQA was established, though the process of establishing reliability for the PQA was more in-depth than for the STEM-PQA (described in the notes below). -->
<!-- ○  Second, use a qualitative approach for the same reasons described in the initial plan - understand quantitative findings that are of particular interest or findings that are discrepant (with other findings or with the study's hypotheses), for example: -->
<!-- ■  Describe the characteristics of aspects of work with data, such as generating data or modeling and analyzing data, to better understand how they are carried out in these out of school STEM programs -->
<!-- ■  Document other characteristics of highly engaging (or disengaging) signals, such as being focused on phenomena, associated with an activity that is sustained over time, and collaborative -->
<!-- ■  Investigate in greater detail findings, such as relationships between the aspects of work with data and the profiles of engagement and its conditions that are of particular interest (such as the relationship between data modeling and one of the profiles) or findings that are discrepant and in need of further investigation in order to be understood better.  -->
<p>In addition to the codes for aspects of work with data, all of the video are also coded as occurring in the classroom or in a field setting. These codes were created by research team members on the basis of documentation from the intermediary program providers, who alternated between classroom and field experiences on the basis of a set schedule. Furthermore, the videos are also coded regarding the instructional leader support for STEM-related practices created through the use of the Program Quality Assessment (Akiva, 2005). Accordingly, codes for instructional leader support for STEM practice to correspond to the codes for work with data will be created. These codes will equal to 1 only when both the aspect of work with data (in Table 5) is present as is the PQA code(s) associated with that aspect of work with data; accordingly, these codes will represent students’ engagement in aspects of work with data that are also observed to be supported by youth instructional leaders. These codes are presented in Table 6.</p>

<div id="codes-for-activity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> Codes for activity</h3>
<p>Codes for the activity are created on the basis of codes for the student activity. A coding frame with the following categories was used to code all of the data. This coding frame included categories for both inquiry-based (i.e., laboratory activties and those in which youth are creating products) as well as more traditional (i.e., listening to a lecture). A code for inquiry-based activities, reflecting activities in which students may be doing more hands-on work that may be supportive of work with data, was created. This code had a value of one if either laboratory activities or those in which youth are creating products had a value of one and was otherwise zero.</p>

<div id="data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Before analyzing data to answer the research questions, preliminary analyses will be carried out. The steps for both preliminary and the primary analyses are described in this section.</p>
<p>Preliminary analyses. Codes for the aspects of work with data will be created from coding videos of the activity occurring immediately before learners were signaled to respond to a survey as part of the ESM. Before one rater independently codes the video associated with all of the signals, inter-rater reliability between the primary and a secondary rater will be established. The coding frame in Table 5 will be used to code a random sample of the videos associated with 30 of the ESM responses. The coding frame will be used to code for the presence of one and only one of the codes for the aspects of work with data. The agreement between the original and second rater will be calculated using Fleiss’ kappa, with a value above .70 indicating satisfactory agreement. If the disagreement is not satisfactory, then cases in which the raters disagreed will be discussed and resolved, and a different sample of videos associated with ESM responses will be coded again. Following the satisfactory agreement, all of the videos associated with ESM signals will be coded independently: In order to provide to the coder the context to the video segments to be coded, all of the video segments will be viewed (but only those associated with ESM signals will be coded).</p>
<p>First-order Pearson correlations, frequency, range, mean, skew, kurtosis, and standard deviations will be examined for all variables including ESM measures for challenge, competence, cognitive, behavioral and affective engagement, and for the pre-survey measure for interest. In addition, the frequency of the codes for aspects of work with data, and the number of responses by student, program, and moment will be examined.</p>
<div id="primary-analyses-for-rq-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Primary analyses for RQ #1</h3>
<p>To answer this question, PECs will be constructed using on the basis of five variables: cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and learners’ perceptions of challenge and competence. Answers to this question will help to understand how the aspects of engagement relate to both one another and to key conditions that influence engagement.</p>
<p>To create PECs, a mixture modeling approach will be carried out. Mixture modeling is an approach for identifying distinct distributions, or mixtures of distributions, of measured variables. A type of mixture modeling within a latent variable modeling framework, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA; Harring &amp; Hodis, 2016; Muthen, 2004) is used in this study, in particular, to identify the number and nature of PECs. LPA allows for capturing the multidimensional nature of engagement. From this approach, different parameters - means, variances, and covariances - are freely estimated across profiles, fixed to be the same across profiles, or constrained to be zero. The MPlus software is commonly used to estimate these models (see <a href="https://www.statmodel.com/examples/mixture.shtml">here</a>) using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters.</p>
<p>LPA can be used to identify common patterns in learners’ ESM responses as part of a person-oriented analysis to construct PECs. These profiles make it possible to analyze the multivariate data collected on engagement in a way that balances the parsimony of a single model for all learners with a recognition of individual differences in how learners’ experience each of the dimensions of engagement together at the same time. A key benefit of the use of LPA, in addition to likelihood estimation-based fit indices, is probabilities of an observation being a member of a cluster, unlike in hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis, for which an observation is hard classified exclusively into one cluster.</p>
<p>As part of LPA, different models that determine whether and how different parameters (i.e., means, variances, and covariances) are estimated. In addition, the number of profiles to estimate must be provided by the analyst. Determining the number of profiles depends on fit statistics (such as information criteria and the entropy statistic) as well as concerns of parsimony and interpretability. In general, the approach to choosing the model is similar to choosing the number of profiles, requiring deciding on the basis of evidence from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Here, the six models that are possible to specify in LPA are described in terms of how the variables used to create the profiles are estimated. Note that <em>p</em> represents different profiles and each parameterization is represented by a 4 x 4 covariance matrix and therefore would represent the parameterization for a four-profile solution. In all of the models, the means are estimated freely in the different profiles. Imagine that each row and column represents a different variable, i.e., the first row (and column) represents broad interest, the second enjoyment, the third self-efficacy, and the fourth another variable, i.e., future goals and plans.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1.1</span> 1. Varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to 0 (model 1)</h4>
<p>In this model, which corresponds to the mclust model wit the name “EEI”, the variances are estimated to be equal across profiles, indicated by the absence of a p subscript for any of the diagonal elements of the matrix. The covariances are constrained to be zero, as indicated by the 0’s between every combination of the variables. Thus, this model is highly constrained but also parsimonious: the profiles are estimated in such a way that the variables’ variances are identical for each of the profiles, and the relationships between the variables are not estimated. In this way, less degrees of freedom are taken used to explain the observations that make up the data. However, estimating more parameters–as in the other models–may better explain the data, justifying the addition in complexity that their addition involves (and their reduction in degrees of freedom).</p>

<p>Profiles will be constructed with the five self-reported ESM measures for cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and perceptions of challenge and competence. Once this step is carried out, the probability of a response being associated with a profile of engagement and its conditions will be used as the dependent variable for subsequent analyses. An interface to the MCLUST software will be developed and used to carry out the LPA. The number of profiles will be determined on the basis of the log-likelihood and bootstrapped likelihood ratio test, entropy, Akaike Information Criteria, and Bayesian Information Criteria statistics, as well as concerns of parsimony and interpretability. Because of sampling error possible through the resampling needed for this approach, the cross-validation will be repeated at least 30 times for each candidate profile solution. This analysis can help us to understand how patterns in higher or lower levels of the variables used to construct the profiles group together in PECs, providing insight into both how engagement is commonly experienced as a meta-construct as well as how key conditions influence engagement.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Primary analyses for RQ #2</h3>
<p>To answer this question, on how well the aspects of instructional support for work with data predict the PECs, first, indicators for activities coded for any of the five aspects of work with data and either of the other two activities will be used to predict each PEC. This will help us to understand how work with data, in general, is different from other activities in terms of predicting each PEC. Next, how each of the five aspects of work with data, as well as the other activities, predict each PEC will be explored. This will help us understand how learners engage in specific aspects of work with data.</p>
<p>Due to similar mixed-effects models used to analyze data to answer RQ #2 and #3, the data analysis strategy for these steps is described together here. First, the general approach used for specifying the mixed effects is first described, followed by details about how the models will be used to provide answers to the specific research questions.</p>
<p>All of the models will use random effects for learner, momentary, and program effects. Learner and moment can be considered to be crossed with both nested within the program. Because the outcome from LPA is not a hard classification (i.e., an observation is in a profile—or not) but a probability, the outcome is treated as a continuous variable. There will be as many models as profiles identified in the preliminary analysis; so, the profile will be different between models. A bottom-up model-building process (West, Welch, &amp; Galecki, 2014), in which a more complex model is constructed on the basis of and continually compared to a more simple model, is used.</p>
<p>First, null models with only the random parts (i.e., random learner, momentary, and program effects) will be specified. Then, the predictors will be added to the model with the main effects of the variables added to the null mixed effects model. The main effects are for the aspects of work with data and instructional support for the aspects of work with data as well as individual interest in STEM (as a control variable). Note that the interaction between individual interest in STEM and the aspects of work with data is added in a separate step, as described in the next section. The model with the random effects for the learner, moment, and program and with the direct effects of all the predictor variables is presented below.</p>
<p>Here, the probability of a response being associated with a profile (obtained through the LPA carried out during the preliminary analyses) is predicted by the direct effects of indicators for the aspects of work with data ([replace]01 – [replace]05 below) measured at the momentary level, their individual interest in STEM ([replace]06), measured at the student level, and the random learner, moment, and program effects ([replace]learner, [replace]moment, and [replace]program). The general specification for the models for learner i during moment j in program k is written as:</p>

</div>
<p>Findings associated with this research question will help us understand how learners engage during different aspects of work with data and how engagement during the aspects of data differ from engagement during non-instructional activities. Another benefit of these models is the variance components, which can be interpreted in terms of the intraclass correlations. Because momentary and learner random effects are crossed and both nested with the program random effects, estimates for each of these random effects can provide information on the sources of unexplained variability in the PECs, thus helping us to understand the amount of variation that variables at each of the levels of the random effects (learner, moment, and program) can be explained.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.3</span> Primary analyses for RQ #3</h3>
<p>To answer this question, on how well the code for the inquiry-based activity predicts the PECs, first, indicators for activities coded for any of the five aspects of work with data will be interacted with a dummy code indicating instructional support in general, created on the basis of any of the variables for instructional support for work with data being equal to 1. This dummy coded variable will then be interacted with any of the aspects of work with data with relations to the PECs. Second, each of aspects of work with data with relations to the PECs will be interacted with a dummy code for the specific aspect of instructional support (in Table 6). This will help us to understand how work with data, in general and in terms of specific forms of instructional support, differs from other activities and how support from the instructor can contribute to more engaging work with data.</p>

<div id="primary-analyses-for-rq-4" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.4</span> Primary analyses for RQ #4</h3>
<p>To answer this question, on how the relationships between work with data and the PECs depends on students’ pre-program interest in STEM, first, differences in the relationships between work with data in general and the PECs on the basis of students’ individual interest in STEM will be explored, using an interaction between practices and individual interest in STEM. These analyses will be carried out separately for relations between work with data (on its own, corresponding to the analyses carried out for RQ #3) and work with data with instructional support (for RQ #4). Next, for any specific aspect of work with data that significantly predicts each PEC, the same will be carried out, so that the interaction between individual interest in STEM and the specific aspect of work with data will be used to predict each PEC. These interactions between individual interest in STEM and the dummy codes for aspects of work with data will be added to the model specification for RQ #2. Answers to this question will help us learn how the relationships between the PECs and the aspects of work with data vary on the basis of a trait-like characteristic of the learner may have important impacts. Given the exploratory nature of discovering which PECs emerge and how other factors relate to them, specific hypotheses are not made at this time.</p>
</div>
<div id="primary-analyses-for-rq-5" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.5</span> Primary analyses for RQ #5</h3>
<p>To answer this question, on the common characteristics of potentially adaptive PECs, a sequential exploratory data analysis strategy is used. While the activity in terms of the aspects of work with data and the other activities likely predicts differences in PECs, there may be other characteristics that predict PECs, and those characteristics that predict potentially adaptive, or beneficial to students’ learning, PECs may be useful to identify both for interpreting findings from the present study and for future research. To answer this question, heterogeneity in terms of how the aspects of work with data relate to the PECs will first be identified. For example, if constructing measures is found to be associated with both potentially adaptive and potentially maladaptive PECs, then videos associated with this aspect of work with data will be interrogated further for this research question.</p>
<p>The use of mixed effects models as part of the earlier research questions provides an especially useful strategy for selecting cases because the random moment effects represent moments that are associated with especially higher probabilities of responses associated with the different PECs. PECs will be identified and then coded qualitatively as part of an Extreme Case Approach. Selection of cases in this way also addresses a key challenge of the Extreme Case Approach, namely, how to present the variability among cases that may be selected because they are so different from the others—and from one another. The videos to select will be identified on the basis of moment-specific predictions accounting for all of the variables used to investigate the relations examined as part of question 2. If the moment-specific prediction for a potentially adaptive profile is especially positive and large, this suggests that there are characteristics of this moment that help to explain how students engaged in the aspects of work with data in highly engaging ways. Similarly, if the moment-specific prediction for a potentially maladaptive profile is especially negative and large, this suggests that there are characteristics of this moment that help to explain how this activity was not highly engaging. This analysis can help us to develop an account of what may distinguish these extreme cases from the majority with respect to the factors that influence engagement in work with data, as well as what may be particular to each specific case (Jahnukainen, 2010). Note that as part of an sequential exploratory mixed methods design, the focus of this qualitative analysis may shift based on what the results of the quantitative analyses suggest.</p>
<p>In the first code-generating inductive step (Hatch, 2002), videos of the moments will be open-coded, in which notes and possible themes are recorded. Examples of potential codes include the factors influencing engagement in work with data presented in Figure 1: phenomena-based investigations, reference to or the presence of repeated cycles of engaging in work with data over time, and collaboration among learners. After open coding, notes and possible themes and the data will be read, and possible patterns in them will be recorded. These patterns will be collapsed into an initial coding frame, consisting of the codes, their description, and an example.</p>
<p>This coding frame is used in the second confirmatory step, which will involve a second rater, similar to the coding for the work with data carried out as part of the preliminary analysis. In the second step, the coding frame will be used to code for the presence of the codes in 20 of the video segments, randomly selected from among those identified as associated with random effects above the 80th percentile for the final models. Like in the preliminary analysis, the agreement between the original and second rater will be calculated using Fleiss’ kappa, with a value above 0.70 indicating satisfactory agreement. If the agreement is not satisfactory, then cases in which the raters disagreed will be discussed and resolved, and a different sample of segments (if there is a sufficient number of samples; because only segments coded for one of the aspects of work with data will be sampled from) will be coded again. Knowing more about what other characteristics of the activity could impact the relationship between aspects of work with data and learners’ engagement can help us to discover particular teaching strategies, instructional practices, and combinations of the aspects of work with data associated with engaging activities.</p>

<div id="power-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Power Analysis</h2>
<p>Few publications and tools address the question of statistical power for models with crossed random effects (Westfall, Kenny, &amp; Judd, 2014). To carry out power analysis for detecting the minimum detectable effect for the relationship between one of the aspects of work with data and profiles of engagement, Westfall et al.’s (2017) software Power Analysis for General Anova designs to calculate power for models with arbitrarily complex random effects structures is used. The power, or [replace], was set to 0.80. The results of the power analysis indicated that a minimum detectable d (effect size) is 0.43, a moderate effect (Cohen, 1992).</p>

<div id="sensitivity-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
<p>For observational studies, such as the present study, it can be important to determine how robust an inference is to alternative explanations. One approach to addressing this is sensitivity analysis, which involves quantifying the amount of bias that would be needed to invalidate an inference (hypothetically, this bias might be due to omitted or confounding variables, measurement, missing data, etc.). Using the approach described in Frank, Maroulis, Duong, and Kelcey (2013), I carried out sensitivity analysis for inferences we made relative to our key findings. The result, and what is used to interpret and contextualize findings, is a numeric value for each effect that indicates the proportion of the estimate that would have to be biased in order to invalidate the inference: higher values indicate more robust estimates in that the inferences would still hold even if there were substantial bias in the estimate.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Limitations</h2>
<p>This study has three primary limitations. First, this study does not consider outcomes from engaging, such as the products of neither students’ work, nor the specific cognitive capabilities they develop through their participation. Second, the context for this study is suited to understanding engagement in aspects of work with data but not explicitly designed for it, and learning environments that deliberately support work with data over a long period may demonstrate different patterns of engagement than those examined in this study because of the focus on and sequencing of the aspects of work with data, which may make it more (or less) cognitively, behaviorally, or affectively engaging than is determined in this study. Third, this program is not representation of all outside-of-school programs, as many of the programs were based on characteristics of model STEM enrichment programs; as a result, engagement may be different in other STEM enrichment programs depending on characteristics of the programs and their activities, and findings from this study should be interpreted in terms of programs that share similar features in terms of their design.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Research Question #1: Profiles of Engagement and Its Conditions (PECs)</h2>
<p>This question addresses what profiles emerged from the data. This section first provides information about the statistical software that was developed and solutions for all models (whether models converged and the log-likelihood was replicated). Then, fit statistics for models that converged and for which the log-likelihood was replicated are described, followed by a comparison of specific, candidate solutions. At the end of this section, models selected are described in detail.</p>
<div id="statistical-software-developed" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.10.1</span> Statistical software developed</h3>
<p>The MPlus software is used to carry out LPA as part of this study. In order to more flexibly carry out LPA, an open-source tool, tidyLPA, was developed. This tool provides interfaces to the MPlus software as well as to the open-source mclust software. In addition to being used as part of this study, this package is provided free of use to other analysts as the first tool dedicated to carrying out LPA as part of the R software. Since being released, the package has been downloaded more than 100 times (Wickham, 2018).</p>
</div>
<div id="overall-solutions-for-all-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.10.2</span> Overall solutions for all models</h3>

<p>First, I examined a wide range of models and solutions. I did this in order to select particular, candidate models to scrutinize in greater detail. In order to carry out this analysis, I followed guidelines recommended by the developers of MPlus (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2012; Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017) as well as those making recommendations about its use (Geiser, 2012). In particular, I set the number of starts to 600 for initial stage starts, and to 120 for the number of starts to be optimized. This means that for each model estimated, 600 random starting values for the parameters were used to initialize the EM algorithm. Of these 600, 120 that demonstrated the lowest log-likelihood were allowed to continue until they reached convergence or the limit for the number of iterations. In order for a model to me considered trustworthy, of these 120 runs, the lowest log-likelihood must be replicated at least one time.</p>
<p>The results are presented in Figure 5.1. If this is the case, then the log-likelihood would appear in the table below; if not, “LL not replicated” is reported as the value. If none of the 120 runs converge, then “Did not converge” is reported as the value. As can be seen from this table, only models associated with model specifications 1 and 2 (and among these two solutions, only those associated with particular number of profiles) converged. Thus, only solutions associated with models 1 (the model with varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to zero) and model 2 (varying means, equal variances, and equal covariances) are explored in subsequent sections.</p>
</div>
<div id="in-depth-statistics-for-particular-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.10.3</span> In-depth statistics for particular models</h3>
<p>After investigating the general information about a range of model solutions, solutions associated with models 1 and 2 are explored in greater detail, following recommendations associated with mixture modeling (Collins and Lanza, 2009; Geiser, 2012) and the authors of the MPlus software (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017) as well as recent peer-reviewed articles (Pastor et al., 2007). For these models, the log-likelihood (LL), a range of information criteria (AIC, BIC, sample adjusted BIC [SABIC], consistent AIC [CAIC]), statistics about the quality of the profile assignments (entropy, which represents the mean posterior probability) are presented.</p>
<p>The information criteria are based on the log-likelihood but take various steps to penalize complex models, and so can be used to directly compare models (i.e., the model with the lowest values for these statistics can be considered to better reflect the underlying properties of the profiles). Simulation studies have suggested that BIC, CAIC, SABIC, and BLRT are most helpful for selecting the correct number of profiles (Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muthen, 2007). For the entropy statistic, higher values are considered better, though scholars have suggested that the entropy statistic not be used for model selection (Lubke &amp; Muthen, 2007).The log-likelihood should not be interpreted directly but is presented in conjunction with the information criteria for context about how each of them differs from the log-likelihood. These are also presented in Figures 5.1 and 5.2</p>
<p>In addition to these statistics, a number of modified likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are used, as the test statistics associated with unmodified LRT do not follow the distribution that the test is based on (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2017). These are the Vu-Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT, Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT, and the bootstrapped LRT. Of the three, the bootstrapped is considered to be the best indicator of which of two models, one nested (with certain parameters fixed to 0) within the other, fits better, but it is also the most computationally-intensive to carry out (Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2012). For each of the LRTs, the test statistic and its associated p-value are provided; a p-value greater than .05 suggests that the model with fewer profiles should be preferred.</p>

Figure 4.3: Fit statistics for model 2
</p>
</div>
<p>Looking across the statistics presented in Table 4.3 and Figures 4.1 and 4.2, some general ideas about which models are to be preferred emerge. Solutions are interpreted first for each model individually and then across models with the goal of choosing a smaller number of models to investigate in more detail.</p>
<p>For solutions associated with model 1, the decrease (indicating a preferred model) in information criteria becomes smaller as the number of profiles increases from 5 to 6 and 6 to 7. A solution associated with 8 profiles did not replicate the log-likelihood and the VLMR and LMR suggest that the solution associated with 9 profiles did not fit better than that with 8 profiles, suggesting that models with 7 or fewer profiles be preferred. Considering these models, the entropy statistic increases by a large amount between the solution associated with 4 and 5 profiles (and then decreases slightly between 5 and 6 and 6 and 7 profile solutions), suggesting (but not providing conclusive evidence) that models 5, 6, or 7 may be preferred. The bootstrapped LRT suggests that, until the log-likelihood is not replicated, every more complex model be selected. Taking these pieces of evidence into conclusion, for model 1, solutions associated with 4 through 7 may be considered in more depth, with an emphasis on solutions associated with profiles with 5 and 6 profiles on the basis of the slowing of the decrease in the information criteria associated with the solutions with greater profiles than these, and the increase in the entropy from 4 to 5 (and 6) profile solutions.</p>
<p>For solutions associated with model 2, only those associated with 2-5 profile solutions were associated with log-likelihoods that were replicated. For these four models, the log-likelihood decreased in a mostly consistent way, such that changes in the decrease are not as evident as those associated with model 1. The entropy statistic decreases from 2 to 3 profile solutions, increases from 3 to 4 profile solutions, and then decreases slightly from 4 to 5 profile solutions, providing some information that models associated with 4 profiles be preferred to the others. All of the LRTs suggest that the more complex model be selected, not providing clear information about which solutions are to be preferred. On the basis of these pieces of evidence, models with 3, 4, and 5 solutions may be considered in more depth. However, there is a lack of consistent evidence favoring more or less complex models.</p>

<div id="comparison-of-candidate-solutions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.10.4</span> Comparison of candidate solutions</h3>
<p>In this section, specific models are examined so that candidate solutions can be compared. For all of the solutions, the data are centered to have a mean equal to 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (thus, the y-axis on each of the plots is labeled “Z-score”).</p>
<div id="model-1-profiles-6" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.10.4.1</span> Model: 1, Profiles: 6</h4>
<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full</strong> profile, profile 6</li>
<li>An <strong>universally low</strong> profile, profile 2</li>
<li>An <strong>all moderate</strong> profile, profile 5–and, like, the model 1, six profile solution–with moderate levels of affective engagement</li>
<li>An <strong>only behaviorally engaged</strong> profile, profile 1, with moderate levels of behavioral engagement, very low affective engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <strong>only affectively engaged</strong> profile, profile 4, with moderate levels of affective engagement, low levels of behavioral engagement, and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and competence</li>
<li>An <strong>engaged and competent but not challenged</strong> profile, profile 3, characterized by high levels of each of the three dimensions of engagement and of competence, but with low levels of challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is somewhat balanced, with the universally low profile with the largest number of observations (<em>n</em> = 667; the same number for this profile as in the model 1, five profile solution), followed by the all moderate profile (<em>n</em> = 638). Each of the other four profiles were associated with 300 to 400 observations. Unlike the model 1, four and five profile solutions, which distinguished observations on <em>either</em> a condition of engagement (i.e., competence) or one of its dimensions (i.e., cognitive, behavioral, and affective), this solution was associated with profiles that distinguished observations on the basis of both: There were profiles for only behaviorally and affectively engaged and for engaged and competent but not challenged. While the engaged and competent but not challenged was distinguished by low levels of challenge–different from the profile associated with the model 1, four profile solution characterized by high levels of competence–this solution is compelling because it appears to group students on the basis of multiple of the indicators, and demonstrate viability on the basis of the fit statistics (i.e., Tables 5.1 and 5.2 and Figure 5.1). The log-likelihood was replicated two times, with the next lowest log-likelihood not being replicated, followed by a log-likelihood that was replicated (at least) seven times. This solution (associated with the log-likelihood that was replicated [at least] seven times) could be investigated in further detail, to see whether–and if so, how–it differs from the solution interpreted here. Pending further exploration, this solution seems like a potential candidate for use in subsequent analyses.</p>

<p>This solution is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full</strong> profile, profile 7</li>

<li>A <strong>competent but not engaged or challenged</strong> profile, profile 2, characterized by high competence and moderate (low) or low levels of engagement and challenge</li>

<li>A <strong>challenged but not engaged or competent</strong> profile, profile 6, characterized by low levels of challenge, and high levels of engagement and competence</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is not very balanced, with few (<em>n</em> = 181) observations associated with the universally low profile and few (<em>n</em> = 222) observations associated with the highly challenged profile. The number of observations associated with the other profiles ranged from 317 to 651. Where the universally low profile exhibited the same number of observations in the model 1, five and six profile solutions, for this solution, there were far fewer observations. Also distinct from other solutions, none of the other five profiles were found in the other model 1 solutions. Two pairs of the profiles–challenged and highly challenged and universally low and moderately low–exhibited similar patterns among the variables that were distinguished by different mean levels. The log-likelihood was replicated twice, with the next lowest log-likelihood being replicate four times, possibly warranting further investigation. Taken together, this solution raises questions about whether it may be too complex, possibly suggesting preference for model 1 five and six profile solutions.</p>

<div id="looking-across-model-1-and-model-2-solutions" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.10.4.3</span> Looking across model 1 and model 2 solutions</h4>
<p>When looking across solutions, some overall patterns in terms of what profiles emerge and some directions for which models are to be selected for use in subsequent analysis can be identified. First, overall patterns are discussed. In table 4.3, which profiles emerge from which solution is presented.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of profiles. Some appear very commonly, particularly those (full and universally low) characterized by high or low levels across all of the variables. Moderate profiles, both all moderate (characterized by moderately high levels across all of the variables) and moderately low (characterized by low levels across all of the variables), also appeared commonly, particularly for the solutions for model 1.</p>

<p>The model 1, six and seven profile solutions are compelling because both show profiles that are distinguished by dimensions of engagement and its conditions (challenge and competence). Note that for this model, only the means and variances are estimated (and so no covariances are estimated), and the variances are constrained to be the same across the profiles. While this is a very restrictive model, it also is a standard model for LPA, in that it meets the assumption of independence (of the variables that make up the profiles–unlike for models in which covariances are estimated) typical common to LPA (see Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2016). For each solution, alternate solutions associated with higher log-likelihoods were explored. One advantage of the six profile solution is that most of its profiles can also be identified in solutions with fewer profiles. For the six profile solutions, this alternate solution was very different, whereas for the seven profile solutions, this alternate solution was highly similar. The model solutions exhibit a less clear pattern in terms of which profiles appear when. All else being equal, on the basis of parsimony, the model 1, six profile solution may be preferred. As a type of sensitivity analysis, the model 1, seven profile solution is also explored, but results for it are included in an appendix. This model is less restrictive but does not meet the assumption of independence; some scholars refer to it, as such, as a general or Guassian mixture model solution, instead of an LPA solution (Bauer, 2004). Because covariances are estimated, relationships between the variables not captured in their mean levels estimated for each profile are also estimated. This suggests that these models may be modeling different relations between the variables than those associated with model 1 and that they may fit the data better, but they are also more complex and so should be interpreted with consideration these added parameters.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.11</span> Research Question #2: Relations Between Instructional Support for Work With Data and the PECs</h2>
<p>Broadly, this question is focused on how instructional support for work with data, as coded from video-recordings of the programs, relates to the PECs. For the primary results for this question, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and youth are used and for the “nesting” of both within each of the nine programs are used. For the outcome (<em>y</em> variable), the probability of a response belonging to the profile is used; thus, there are six models, for each of the six profiles, for each specification of the predictor (<em>x</em>) variables.</p>
<p>First, null models showing the proportion of variance (via the intra-class correlation) are interpreted. The more detailed results (in a table) are presented in the appendix. These are followed by the interpretation of findings related to a more variable-centered approach, namely, correlations between individual aspects of work with data and the composite and the profiles (and the variables that make them up) and individual interest. Finally, results of mixed effects models with the work with data variables added separate and then with the composite for instructional support for work with data are interpreted and presented.</p>
<div id="null-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.11.1</span> Null models</h3>
<p>The null models presented in table 4.5 provide insight into the levels at which predictors may be able to explain the outcome. For all six profiles, the ICCs were very small, from 0.00 to 0.023. This suggests that very little variability can be explained simply by the program. For the momentary level, the ICCs were also very small, ranging from 0.004 to 0.011. Finally, the youth-level ICCs ranged from .099 to .427. Noteworthy, the ICC was highest for the full profile. The other profile characterized by a consistent pattern across all of the variables–the universally low profile–had a modest ICC, .265.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.11.2</span> Correlations between individual aspects of work with data and the composite and the profiles and individual interest</h3>
<p>First, a correlation matrix of each of the profiles and each of the aspects of work with data (as well as overall pre interest and an overall measure of work with data) is presented. Most noteworthy is the very small correlations between the aspects of work with data and the profiles; these correlations range (in absolute values) from .00 to .05. Only the relations between communicating and profile six are statistically significant. The composite variable was correlated with the profiles from (in absolute values) 0.002 to 0.035, none statistically significant. The aspects of work with data are modestly correlated with one another, with correlations ranging from .16 to .46; all were significant.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether there were greater correlations with the variables that make up the profiles, the correlations between the five variables that comprise the PECs and the five aspects of work with data were examined. These correlations were about the same as those between the profiles and the aspects of work with data, ranging from (in absolute value terms) .00 to .06.</p>

<p>Next, correlations between individual aspects of work with data (and the composite) and the variables that make up the profiles are presented. These correlations suggest that the aspects of work with data are not only not related to the profiles, but also not related to the aspects of work with data (with values ranging from .00 to .06).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.11.4</span> Models with the work with data variables added separate</h3>
<p>When the predictor variables for work with data are added, some overall patterns and specific findings can be identified. The only relations with <em>p</em>-values that were below the criterion for statistical significance (.05) were for the relations between modeling data and full engagement (<em>B</em> = 0.03 (0.016), <em>p</em> = .04) and between generating data and full engagement (<em>B</em> = 0.03 (0.016), <em>p</em> = .03). Sensitivity analysis for the effect of generating data suggested that 1.47% of the inference would have to be due to bias to invalidate the inference, suggesting that this effect is not very robust to potential sources of bias, such as an omitted (in this analysis) confounding (or control) variable. For the effect of modeling, this effect was no longer significant when the Kenward-Roger approximation was used. The results were similar for the effect of generating data. For this profile, the participant-level ICC decreased slightly.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.11.6</span> Looking across findings for research question #2</h3>
<p>When looking across findings, we find very few relations between instructional support for work with data and the profiles. The effects that were found (i.e., between modeling and generating data and full engagement) were very small in terms of their practical significance or were not very robust. Broadly, reasons for why this may be–focusing on the characteristics of instructional support for work with data in the context of summer STEM programs and how this support is measured in terms of codes from the video–are the focus on research question #5 and are discussed in the next chapter. Moreover, these findings are deepened in subsequent analyses for research questions #3 and #4.</p>

<p>Broadly, this question is focused on how the activity, in terms of whether students are doing an inquiry-based activity, relates to the profiles. Like for research question #2, for the primary results for this question, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and youth are used and for the “nesting” of both within each of the nine programs are used; instead of codes for instructional support for work with data, codes for the activity are used.</p>
<p>First, differences across profiles by youth activity and by the variables that make up the profiles by youth activity are described. Next, findings from mixed effects models predicting profiles on the basis of the inquiry based activity are interpreted (like for research question #1, additional materials are included in the appendix), in order to see the effect of the activity on its own (indepedent from instructional support for work with data. Next, the composite for work with data is added to these models, and these models are interpreted. Finally, models with activity interacted with the composite are presented and interpreted.</p>

<p>These models show that the activity predicts full engagement (<em>B</em> = .027 (0.016), <em>p</em> &lt; .001). However, this effect is associated with a very small coefficient. Sensitivity analysis suggests that 51.55% of the inference would need to be due to bias to invalidate the effect. None of the other profiles were statistically significantly related.</p>

<div id="models-with-activity-and-the-composite" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.12.4</span> Models with activity and the composite</h3>
<p>These models show that the activity is still related to full engagement (<em>B</em> = 0.063 (0.015), <em>p</em> &lt; .001) and that the work with data composite is related to only behavioral (<em>B</em> = 0.008 (0.004), <em>p</em> = .016). The effect of activity is robust, with 53.08% of the effect needing to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. The effect of the composite was not, with only 1.375% of the effect needing to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. These patterns were very similar to those found in earlier models with each of the predictor variables on their own.</p>

The effect of activity was once again robust, with 34.35% of the effect needing to be due to bias to invalidate the inference; the effect of the composite on the probability of an only behavioral profile was not as robust, with 18.93% of the effect needing to be due to bias to invalidate the inference.</p>

<div id="looking-across-findings-for-research-question-3" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.12.6</span> Looking across findings for research question #3</h3>
<p>The strongest finding appears to be the relation between inquiry-based activities and full engagement; the difference in probability of full engagement was around 0.06 - 0.07, suggesting that this profile was around 6-7% more likely when learners were doing one of these activities. This effect was fairly robust to potential sources of bias. Reasons for the effect of the activity are explored further as part of research question #5 and are discussed in the next chapter. Apart from full engagement, the models presented in this section suggest minimal relations between inquiry-based activities and the profiles. Importantly, these inquiry-based activities do not necessarily involve work with data, suggesting that the activity in general may impact learners’ (full) engagement, but that support for specific activities may not. In the next section, the interactive effect of the factors explored as part of research questions #2 and #3 (instructional support for work with data and the activity being inquiry-based) with learners’ pre-program interest is described.</p>

<p>Research question #4 is focused on how the relationships of instructional support for work with data and the activity differ on the basis of pre-program interest. Like for the previous two research questions, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and the youth–and their nesting within the programs–are used. Findings from models with pre interest, composite, and activity are interpreted, and findings from models with pre interest interacted with the composite, and with pre interest interacted with youth activity, are presented and interpreted.</p>

Interest predicted the engaged and competent but not challenged profile (<em>B</em> = 0.037 (0.016), <em>p</em> = .008). 43.69% of the effect of activity upon full engagement would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference. The effect of the composite on behavioral was not robust, with only 1.34% needing to be due to bias to invalidate the inference.
