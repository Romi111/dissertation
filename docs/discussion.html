<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Key findings for research question #1 (on the frequency and nature of work with data)</h3>
<p>In terms of the frequency and nature of work with data, work with data was found to be common in the summer STEM programs that made the context for this study. A coding frame synthesized from past research carried out in STEM domains on work with data was used to find that work with work with data occurred from around one-quarter of the time of the program’s time (making observations) to around one-half of the program’s time (generating data and communicating findings). Data modeling was, like making observations, less common, whereas asking questions and generating data, like communicating findings, were relatively more common. These findings are as expected based on past research (Lee &amp; Wilkerson, in press) and given the design and goals of summer STEM programs (Dabney et al., 2012; Elam et al., 2012), including those participating in the present study.</p>
<p>In-depth qualitative showed that asking questions, generating data, and interpreting and communicating findings, the three aspects that were <em>more frequent</em> in the programs, also were more consistent with general aspects of learner-centered, hands-on STEM activities, and not as consistent with work with data in particular. This suggests that while work with data is somewhat common, qualitative analysis is an important part of understanding youths’ engagement in work with data. More veridical forms of it are somewhat less common, occurring in around 25% of the programs’ time. While descriptive in nature, these results present the first insight that I am aware of of the extent of work with data in STEM enrichment programs. They suggest that, as past scholarship (National Research Council, 2009, 2012) can provide a context for youth to be involved in the type of scientific and engineering practices-focused activities that can be particularly powerful for youth (and students) in terms of their learning.</p>
</div>
<div id="key-findings-for-research-question-2-what-profiles-of-engagement-emerge" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Key findings for research question #2 (what profiles of engagement emerge)</h3>
<p>Six profiles of engagement and its conditions were identified. These were selected using a rigorous model selection approach and through use of a sophisticated modeling approach (LPA) and statistically software developed for this analysis (tidyLPA). These profiles included those that were strongly negative (<em>Universally low</em>) and strongly positive (<em>Full</em>), as well as those characterized by different levels of engagement (<em>Only behavioral</em> and <em>Only affective</em>) and by different levels of the conditions of engagement (Engaged and Competent but not Challenged). An <em>All moderate</em> profile was also identified. The profiles suggest that the experiences of youth in summer STEM programs are variable and that the use of ESM can aid in the study of youths’ engagement. Little research has examined profiles of engagement, though Schmidt et al. (2018) examined profiles of momentary engagement, constructed from items for cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement (but not perceptions of challenge and competence), and found six profiles, some of which partially overlap with those found in the present study. In particular, on the basis of the items shared between the studies, a <em>Universally low</em>, <em>All moderate</em>, and <em>Full</em> profile were found in both studies. However, as these profiles are characterized by the (uniform) level across all of the variables, this is only limited evidence for the presence of these profiles in the larger population of youth engaged in science and STEM-related learning activities.</p>
</div>
<div id="key-findings-for-research-question-3-how-work-with-data-relates-to-engagement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Key findings for research question #3 (how work with data relates to engagement)</h3>
<p>Before relations between the groups of “predictor” variables, work with data and youth characteristics, and the profiles, were explored, the amount of variability that could be explained at the program, youth, and momentary levels were explored; use of cross-classified mixed effects models were particularly helpful for this goal. The amount of variability that could be explained at the program and momentary level was small (no larger for any profile than .023, and as low as .00 at the program level and .004 at the momentary level for some profiles), while the amount of variability that could be explained at the youth level was moderate to large (between .099 and .427). This suggests that while there is variability in the composition of the profiles that were identified, youth characteristics–their pre-program thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics and their inclination to engage in particular ways throughout the program–largely explains the prevalence of the profiles. This also suggests that what youth do during the programs, and the design and implementation of the programs themselves, have little to do with how youth engage in them. This implies that even the strongest predictor variables at these (momentary and program) levels would likely not explain much variability in the profiles (though this is not always the case, as there are cases in which adding variables at one level can increase the amount of variability that can be explained at another; Gelman &amp; Hill, 2007).</p>
<p>In line with what the preliminary analysis of the amount of variability that could be explained at the youth, momentary, and program levels, relations between work with data were largely not found, though some small, statistically significant relations were identified. Importantly, both generating and modeling data were found to be positively related to the <em>Full</em> profile, suggesting that when youth are involved in these practices, then they are more likely to report high levels of cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and high perceptions of competence and challenge. The effect of data modeling was more robust than that for generating data, the latter which should be interpreted with caution. In short, this suggests that these activities are beneficial to youths’ engagement. Both communicating and interpreting findings and the composite measure for work with data were positively related to the <em>Only behavioral</em> profile and these findings were fairly robust. This profile may indicate that students are experiencing a routine engagement (and not particularly adaptive) when they are communicating findings and being involved in work with data in general. As there is no research on how work with data relates to youths’ engagement, the findings associated with this research question provide some, albeit limited, evidence (and directions for future research) for how some aspects of work with data relate to youths’ engagement.</p>
</div>
<div id="key-findings-for-research-question-4-how-youth-characteristics-relate-to-engagement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.4</span> Key findings for research question #4 (how youth characteristics relate to engagement)</h3>
<p>Not as much in line with expectations given the preliminary analysis, relations between youth characteristics and the profiles were found to be small. In this way, these small relations were similar (in magnitude) to those between work with data and the profiles. Youth with higher pre-program interest were more likely to be <em>Engaged and competent but not challenged</em>, suggesting that youth with higher interest in STEM are inclined to be highly engaged and good at what they are doing, but are not challenged by the activities they experience. This could be a function of the relationship between youths’ interest and their competence before the program, which are often strongly related ([add]); these youth, as a result of their higher interest and competence, need more challenging activities to be more fully engaged. This effect was fairly robust. The interaction with gender and the work with data composite revealed a positive relationship with <em>Full</em> engagement, suggesting that the more that female youth work with data, the more likely they are to be positively engaged. However, sensitivity analysis revealed that this effect was not very robust, which, along with its small magnitude, suggests that it should be interpreted with some caution. Finding that female youth who are engaged in work with data are more likely to be fully engaged is important, given that past research has suggested that female students are less likely to be engaged in STEM classes but we have limited information about what types of instruction may best support female students to be engaged and successful (e.g., Patall et al., 2017).</p>

<div id="limitations-of-the-study-and-recommendations-for-future-research" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Limitations of the Study and Recommendations for Future Research</h2>
<p>This study examines youths’ engagement as an outcome. Accordingly, outcomes from engaging, such as the products of neither youths’ work or the specific cognitive capabilities they develop through their participation, are not the focus. Thus, while some findings about how work with data and youth characteristics were found to be associated with different profiles of engagement and its conditions, we do not have an understanding of how engaging in more or less adaptive ways relates to these outcomes. Examining how work with data and engagement relate to key learning, motivational, and future goals and plans-related outcomes is a topic for future research.</p>
<p>Another limitation concerns the context of the study, summer STEM programs. While the programs that were involved in the study have many affordances for work with data and for being highly engaging for youth, they have some limitations, too, particularly with respect to support work with data. Importantly, these were not programs explicitly designed to support work with data; while such contexts are being developed, they are not yet widespread. Learning environments that deliberately support work with data over a long period may demonstrate different patterns of engagement than those examined in this study because of the focus on and sequencing of the aspects of work with data, which may make it more (or less) cognitively, behaviorally, or affectively engaging than is determined in this study. As Miller, Manz, Russ, Stroupe, and Berland (2018) highlight, truly engaging STEM activities are not easily come by; they require students to take ownership over and to make decisions about their explorations or designs. Thus, future research may study work with data in contexts designed to support it. A key part of this future research may be studying both work with data and how work with data is supported (most importantly by the instructor but also by the curriculum and technological tools).</p>
<p>A related limitation is that the programs that were the focus of this study were model programs, or those based on characteristics of exemplary STEM enrichment programs. As a result, engagement may be different in other STEM enrichment programs depending on characteristics of the programs and their activities, and findings from this study should be interpreted in terms of programs that share similar characteristics.</p>
<p>A potential issue concerns the analytic approach. As noted above, the profiles demonstrated very little variability at the program and momentary level, suggesting that factors at this level would likely not strongly predict the profiles. This could be a function of the use of profiles and the specific variables selected. It may also be the result of the outcome (engagement and its conditions) selected. Other analytic approaches can be carried out to determine the viability of the profiles approach and use of the items for engagement and its conditions for understanding work with data.</p>
<p>A final limitation concerns the measures used. In particular, the qualitative coding revealed alignment but also discrepancies between work with data as determined from the PQA codes and the conceptual framework for work with data. While these issues were small, they suggest that the coding frame for work with data is a limitation of the present study.</p>
<p>While these are important limitations, it is worth noting that the modeling strategy (with the mixed effects models) in inherently a conservative approach. Thus, while the findings detected are small, they can be considered to be trustworthy on the basis of the way the ESM data were analyzed. This trustworthiness is enhanced by the use of sensitivity analysis, which showed how much of the effects could be due to bias for them to be invalidated.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Engage youth in key aspects of work with data</h3>
<p>While limited evidence, this study suggests that generating and modeling data in particular may be beneficial in terms of engaging youth. Generating data in particular may be a key practice because it involves making work with data concrete; as Lehrer and Schauble (2015) describe, recording data in the form of “inscriptions” can serve as commitments that learners make (in terms of what data were chosen to be collected and recorded). This implication, in particular, should be interpreted with caution, however, given the very small magnitude of the effect. Similarly, data modeling has been described as <em>the</em> central scientific and engineering practice (Schwarz et al., 2009; Lehrer &amp; Schauble, 2015; Weisberg, 2012), and its relations with full engagement provides some actionable evidence for its importance in the context of summer STEM programs.</p>
<p>Practically, youth activity leaders (in summer STEM and other STEM enrichment contexts) and teachers (in formal learning environments) can best include the beneficial practices of generating and modeling data not in isolation, but rather through involving learners in complete cycles of investigation. This aligns with both foundational and contemporary research on work with data in education (Berland et al., 2018; McNeill &amp; Berland, 2017; Hancock et al., 1992; Lee &amp; Wilkerson, 2018). Recent curricular reform efforts also suggest that the best way to engage learners in particular practices is through the process of identifying a question or problem, marshaling sources of data that can be used to figure out what is happening, and developing model-based explanations that are then communicated (or even used in an argument; National Governors Association, 2013; National Research Council, 2012; NGSS Lead States, 2013). With respect to work with data in particular, youth activity leaders and teachers can use the findings from this study as a starting point to consider how engaging in work with data may also prepare learners to think of, understand, and take action based on data in their day-to-day lives. Many questions or problems learners face may involve data that can be meaningfully incorporated into engaging learning activities.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Leverage the affordances of summer STEM and other STEM enrichment programs</h3>
<p>Another implication for practice concerns the affordances (and constraints) of summer STEM and other STEM enrichment programs. One affordance of these programs relevant to these informal and to K-12 learning environments concerns selecting activities that are engaging to learners. For example, in the <em>Marine Investigators</em>, youth participated in activities designed to help them understand water quality in their ecosystem. Youth collected trash from sites around their community (in different “districts”) and then brought the trash and recyclable plastic back to the classroom. Then, the youth activity leaders asked students to figure out how much plastic enters local waterways. As a part of this activity, youth activity leaders asked students not only to determine the quantity of trash that entered the waterways, but asked students about <em>why</em> they used math in particular ways (i.e., adding the quantity of trash collected and then extrapolating from this quantity to the amount from across the entire city over the course of the year). This appeared to be a powerful activity, one that was coded as involving all five aspects of work with data according to the measures for instructional support for work with data; this type of activity seemed to suggest that instructional support for work with data may impact youth’s engagement.</p>
<p>Another affordance concerned the relevance of the program to youth’s lives. For example, in the <em>Building Mania</em> program, youth are involved in engineering design (i.e., identifying a problem and designing a solution), particularly around the use of simple machines. In a day in the classroom setting, youth are creating, testing, and revising catapults. In the next day, youth visit an area University, and are led in a discussion by a physicist who works with particle colliders. In this example, the expertise of the physicist, who explicitly mentions the benefits of engaging in the engineering design process and the importance of combining engineering to addressing problems (such as mitigating the damage of earthquakes), seems to be highly relevant to what youth are doing in their class. In these two days of class, youth are engaged in different aspects of work with data as indicated by the codes for instructional support for work with data (collecting data on the efficacy of their designs in the classroom day, and asking questions in the subsequent day, particularly); these seem to suggest, like the example of work work with data from the <em>Marine Investigators</em> program, affordances of work with data for summer STEM programs.</p>

<div id="consider-the-constraints-of-summer-stem-and-other-stem-enrichment-programs" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Consider the constraints of summer STEM and other STEM enrichment programs</h3>
<p>There are also constraints to summer STEM and other STEM enrichment programs. For example, youth activity leaders faced challenges linking activities as part of a complete cycle of investigation. For example, in the <em>Ecosphere</em> program, youth collected water samples in the field. They then brought these samples to the classroom and tested the water, involving students in both collecting and, to a degree, generating data (by noting the pH levels of the water). However, later in the day, youth created a small-scale model (with inclined trays of dirt, rocks, and plants) of an ecosystem, in which they added food coloring to determine the impacts of chemicals and acid rain. Youth then interpreted and discussed these findings, but did not connect the discussion to the water samples youth collected and tested earlier. This activity presented an opportunity for deeper engagement, in which youth could interpret and communicate findings related to the state of the water in their ecosystem, but, instead, it was potentially limiting in terms of youth’s engagement in work with data.</p>
<p>Another constraint related to the challenge of linking activities concerned what the programs focused on. For example, the mathematics-focused programs, such as the <em>Adventures in Mathematics</em> program, the youth activity leaders recognizing that youth had difficulty solving equations, used duct tape and a “hippity hoppity”, building on an earlier activity in which youth considered what constituted a rate, on how many “hops” it would take someone to move from one end of the line of duct tape to the other; the youth activity leader than asked youth to consider how far they could move in one hop and to consider how they could find out many hops it would take, using a mathematical equation. In this activity, youth were supported to approach mathematics problem-solving in creative ways. However, apart from data modeling, other aspects of work with data were rarely present, and most of the data that youth worked with was provided by the teacher or considered in the abstract. Programs focused on science or engineering, similarly, emphasized other aspects of work with data: The science-focused programs (<em>Island Explorers</em>, <em>The Ecosphere</em>, and <em>Marine Investigators</em>) all emphasized collecting and generating data, but data, particularly the data collected or generated, was rarely modeled or interpreted. In the engineering-focused programs (<em>Uptown Architecture</em>, <em>Crazy Machines</em>, and <em>Dorchester House</em>, youth often collected data that resulted from their engineering designs, and communicated and interpreted their findings, but, did not generate data, and, accordingly, (and like the science-focused programs) did not model data as a regular part of their activities. This finding suggests that while work with data may have been common overall, different aspects of instructional support for work with data were emphasized to different degrees based on the focus of the program.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Each of the disciplines that contribute to STEM learning involve work with data and how youth and students work with data in engaging ways is a concern of researchers and practitioners. While past research has focused on what practices learners do when working with data, or specific conceptual outcomes, little research has considered youths’ experience of working with data. In this study, engagement was used as a lens to understand the experience of youth working with data in the context of nine summer STEM programs. In particular, five aspects of work with data, a) asking questions, b) observing phenomena, c) constructing measures and generating data, d) data modeling, and e) interpreting and communicating findings, were identified from video-recordings of the programs. These codes were then used to predict profiles, or distinct groups on the basis of different levels, of youths’ cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and two other variables, youths’ perceptions of challenge and competence. These measures were obtained using an innovative method, ESM, that provides some access to youths’ experience in-the-moment of the activities they were involved in during the program.</p>
<p>Findings indicate that work with data occurs regularly in the programs and that there are some examples of ambitious activities centered on working with real-world data (and examples in which the work with data is not fully aligned with youth-driven work with data). Six profiles of engagement and its conditions were identified, representing different configurations of the three dimensions of engagement and its conditions. Relations of work with data and youth characteristics (pre-program interest in STEM and youths’ gender and status in terms of being a member of under-represented groups in STEM) were, overall, not strongly related with the profiles of engagement and its conditions, though some key findings were identified. Generating and modeling data were both related to the most potentially beneficial profile, one characterized by high levels of all five of the variables used to create the profiles. Female youth who were involved in work with data (at the momentary level) to a greater extent were also more likely to be fully engaged. This study suggests that work with data has purchase as an organizing set of activities for STEM can have some benefits in terms of understanding the nature of what youth do in summer STEM programs. In addition, this study shows that ESM and engagement can be used to understand youths’ experiences. Data–and who is able to work with data–have important roles in STEM learning and in society; efforts to understand and support learners engaging in these ambitious activities should be encouraged and expanded.</p>
