<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 5</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>Each of the disciplines that contribute to STEM learning - science, technology and computer science, engineering, and mathematics - involve work with data. While past research has focused on what aspects of work with data learners are involved in with respect to work with data, or specific conceptual outcomes from working with data, little research has considered youths’ engagement when they work with data. In this study, engagement was used as a lens to understand the experience of youth working with data during summer STEM programs. In particular, five aspects of work with data, a) asking questions, b) observing phenomena, c) constructing measures and generating data, d) data modeling, and e) interpreting and communicating findings, were identified from video-recordings of the programs. The nature and frequency of these codes was explored, and then the codes were used to predict, along with youths’ characteristics, profiles of engagement. These profiles of engagement depict distinct groups on the basis of different levels, of youths’ cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and youths’ perceptions of challenge and competence.</p>
<p>Findings indicate that work with data occurs frequently in the programs and that there are some examples of ambitious activities centered on working with real-world data as well as some that highlight the heterogeneity in how work with data is enacted in them. Six profiles of engagement were identified, representing different configurations of engagement. Relations of work with data and youth characteristics (pre-program interest in STEM and youths’ gender and status in terms of being a member of under-represented groups in STEM) were, overall, not strongly related with the profiles of engagement, though some key findings were identified. Generating and modeling data were both related to the most potentially beneficial profile, one characterized by high levels of all five of the variables used to create the profiles. This study suggests that work with data has affordances in terms of understanding the nature of what youth do in summer STEM programs. These findings also show the value of an innovative method, ESM, and a modeling approach designed to identify engagement in a holistic manner, LPA, that together provide some access to youths’ experience in-the-moment of the activities they were involved in during the program. Data, and who is able to work with it, important roles in STEM learning and in society; efforts to understand and support learners engaging in these ambitious activities should be encouraged and expanded.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Key findings related to work with data in summer STEM programs</h2>
<!-- I feel like this could all be dealt with in 2 paragraphs – there is a lot of work with data going on, with a mix of student-led activities and instructor led activities. So, on one hand we might expect lots of engagement in these activities. (setting up the point later, that surprise – we don’t see these activities as impacting engagement!) -->
<!-- Generality versus specificity; linking to other aspects -->
<p>Work with data was common in the summer STEM programs. 170 out of the 236 instructional episodes contained at least one of the five aspects (asking questions, making observations, generating data, data modeling, and interpreting and communicating findings) of work with data. The use of video-recordings of the programs and the strategy of using ESM to select (mostly) random samples of youths’ experiences during the programs enabled me to show just how frequent work with data was, and I found that specific aspects of work with data were more or less frequent: Making observations, in some form, occurred during 24% of the program’s time, for example, while generating data and communicating findings both occurred more frequently, during 43% of the instructional episodes. These findings, broadly, suggest that work with data occurred enough that we might expect to see differences in youths’ engagement.</p>
<p>Given the design and goals of summer STEM programs, these align with what may be expected given past research: Such programs are designed to engage youth in the practices, including and as I argue earlier <em>especially</em> those relating to work with data, of STEM domains (Dabney et al., 2012; Elam et al., 2012). Even still, these are the first results of this kind (in terms of the proportion of the time spent in the programs). Using video-recording data and a sampling strategy that can provide insight into the amount of overall time spent was an important component of achieving these findings. While there are not other results of this particular kind, a related, an area of related work concerns other studies that have used the PQA measure. However, studies have (yet) used the version that is adapted for STEM content areas. Some reports call for greater use of measures (such as the PQA) in the study (and evaluation) of summer and outside-of-school STEM programs (e.g., Yohalem et al., 2005). As one example of such a study (but one that is not focused on STEM), Smith et al. (2012) reported findings from a continuous improvement intervention (that used a rigorous experimental design), finding that the intervention positively impacted the quality of instruction in the programs.</p>
<p>In addition to work with data being common, it was highly varied in nature. In-depth qualitative analysis revealed that there was often a variety of ways in which each of the aspects were carried out, with implications for how youth may engage in each of them. Many times, youth engaged in what can be described as ambitious and potentially highly engaging ways of being involved in work with data. When youth were asking questions, 39% of the time they worked to make predictions or hypotheses about the phenomena they were exploring or the problem they were seeking to solve. When making observations, in 86% of the episodes, they did so of phenomena in the field (such as an estuary or an island in the case of science-focused programs). In mathematics and engineering-focused programs, such observations were of the physical objects that youth created in workshops or were through computers in classroom settings. These findings suggest, broadly, that there were opportunities available for youth to be highly engaged in work with data.</p>
<p>When generating data, many times (in 47% of the episodes that involved this aspect) youth recorded their own observations; when modeling data, youth were involved (in 72% of the episodes) in the use of statistical and mathematical models of real-world phenomena. When interpreting and communicating findings, youth regularly (during 48% of episodes) had opportunities to share (with other youth in the program) what they found or created as a result of their earlier investigations or work. Also of note was what occurred during the rest of the time: When youths’ questions, for example, were not focused on predicting or hypothesizing about what they were exploring, type of question was more general, or was instructor-led, rather than driven by youth, forms of work with data that is much more variable than may be expect by recent reform efforts (i.e., National Research Council, 2012; NGSS Lead States, 2013; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010), but more expected given past research pointing out variability in what evidence and data mean, especially in science education settings (McNeill and Berland, 2017; Lehrer &amp; Schauble, 2015).</p>
<p>Also of note was the frequency of these three aspects of work with data overall: They occurred much more frequently than the two (making observations and data modeling) for which a larger proportion of their enactment was more in-line with policy and curricular standards. The type of activities that may be the most demanding for youth were still common, but not quite as common as the overall frequencies presented for the quantitative would suggest.</p>
<p>While descriptive in nature, these results present the first insight into the extent of work with data in STEM enrichment programs. They suggest that, as past scholarship (National Research Council, 2009, 2012) can provide a context for youth to be involved in the type of scientific and engineering practices-focused activities that can be particularly powerful for youth (and students) in terms of their learning. The use of video-recordings of data was especially helpful in establishing this descriptive data.</p>
<p>Past research does point out the heterogeneity in how work with data is enacted in educational settings. Past research, for example, highlights use of “data to solve real problems and to ask authentic questions” (Hancock et al., 1992, p. 337). Research on generating data emphasized an aspect not very much the focus of the present research, namely, structuring data into spreadsheets (Konold, Finzer, &amp; Kreetong, 2017; Lehrer &amp; Kim, 2009). Research on posing questions that can be answered with data shows that there is a connection between student-centered teaching strategies and students’ ability to ask empirical (Bielik &amp; Yarden, 2016). This suggests a reason why youth were able to ask questions and ideas for how they might do so more: Make activities in summer STEM program youth-centered, rather than instructor-centered. Research on the data modeling aspect of work with data highlights the use of statistical models much more than the physical models which were sometimes found to be a way in which youth engaged in data modeling (Petrosino, Lehrer, &amp; Schauble, 2003; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, &amp; Gupta, 2008; Lee, Angotti, &amp; Tarr, 2010). Nevertheless, many of the ways youth engaged in data modeling aligned with this past research, particularly when the goal of the activity is to model variability. This past research that encouraging youth to consider summaries of data, such as the mean and standard deviation, may be a promising way for them to engage more deeply in data modeling (Lehrer, Kim, &amp; Schauble, 2007; Lehrer &amp; Schauble, 2004). In this way, some (but not all) of the aspects work with data aligned with past research; when they align, they are encouraging, and when they do not, some ideas for how to involve youth in more engaging aspects of work with data are able to be identified.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Key findings related to engagement</h2>
<p>Six profiles of engagement were found using a rigorous model selection approach. Before discussing these results in-depth, it is important to note that LPA is an exploratory approach: The number and nature of the profiles identified were found through a rigorous and systematic approach, but this is not a guarantee that the same number and make-up of profiles would emerge in other samples and other contexts: These profiles should be considered as initial evidence, and not as proof that these are <em>the</em> six profiles of engagement that will exist in all settings.</p>
<p>The number of profiles found is broadly similar to that found in past research. Six profiles is the same number of profiles of engagement identified in recent, past research and the similar number provides further information about the nature of engagement in educational contexts: Schmidt et al. (2018) found six profiles of engagement. Their profiles were constructed on the basis of the indicators (cognitive, behavioral, and affective) of engagement, and not perceptions of challenge and competence. As Schmidt et al.‘s study is the only other to examine engagement profiles, another point of comparison is other, similar outcomes, including youths’ (and students’) motivation (see Wormington and Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2017, for a review in motivational settings). Wormington and Linnenbrink-Garcia (2017) report that, usually, a smaller number, with only two of the 22 studies reviewed finding six profiles. This suggests, on the basis of this study and Schmidt et al.’s (2018) study, that there may be a greater variety of types of engagement exhibited than, for example, types of motivation.</p>
<p>In terms of the make-up of the specific profiles, those found in the present study included those that were strongly negative (<em>Universally low</em>) and strongly positive (<em>Full</em>), as well as those characterized by different levels of engagement (<em>Only behavioral</em> and <em>Only affective</em>) and by different levels of the conditions of engagement (Engaged and Competent but not Challenged). An <em>All moderate</em> profile was also identified. Little research has examined profiles of engagement, though Schmidt et al. (2018) examined profiles of engagement, constructed from items for cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement (but not perceptions of challenge and competence), and found six profiles, some of which partially overlap with those found in the present study. In particular, on the basis of the items shared between the studies, a <em>Universally low</em>, <em>All moderate</em>, and <em>Full</em> profile were found in both studies. However, as these profiles are characterized by the (uniform) level across all of the variables, this is only limited evidence for the presence of these profiles in the larger population of youth engaged in science and STEM-related learning activities.</p>
<p>These profiles have implications for the study of engagement and the analysis of multidimensional data on youth and student engagement. First, they suggest that perceptions of challenge and competence be considered in future research. This is because some of the profiles were distinguished on their basis. This approach also may be more parsimonious than including perceptions of challenge and competence as separate predictors (i.e., Shernoff et al., 2003). In addition to these empirical reasons, past research on engagement (i.e., Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) and on the profile approach (Bergman &amp; Magnusson, 1997) suggest that they are theoretically inseparable from engagement, another reason for modeling them as they were modeled in the present study. These implications are specific to the study of engagement but also highlight some of the promise of the profile approach, as well.</p>

<p>The source of variation in the profiles of engagement that <em>can be</em> explained can be due to many different factors, including individual differences between youth, the nature of the instruction carried out, and program-specific factors. Knowing about these sources provide valuable information in their own right, a benefit of the use of mixed effects models (Gelman &amp; Hill, 2007). First, this study explored the sources of variability for the profiles of engagement, revealing that little variability was at the instructional episode level (important given that work with data is a variable at this level) and at the program level. This suggests that engagement, as measured in this context with ESM and with the engagement items used, may be more stable than dynamic at the instructional episode level, differing from some past theory (e.g., Skinner &amp; Pitzer, 2012) and research that showed relations between instructional episode-level variables and engagement (e.g., Shernoff et al., 2016; Shumow, Schmidt, &amp; Zaleski, 2013). This also suggests that variables at these levels do not have a substantial proportion of variability to explain: Predictor variables (like those for the aspects of work with data) at the instructional episode level had much less variability to explain, while those at the youth level had a substantial amount that was able to be explained.</p>
<p>In line with what the sources of variability would suggest, relations between work with data were largely not found, though some small, statistically significant relations were identified. These findings, overall, were not necessarily surprising given past research: The question of whether and how work with data relates to engagement has not been the focus of any past research. In this sense, these are important findings that suggest that work with data may not be strongly related to engagement.</p>
<p>Given the small amount of variability at the instructional episode level, this result was anticipated (on this basis). Importantly, however, there were some noteworthy findings. In particular, both generating and modeling data were found to be positively (and statistically significantly) related to the <em>Full</em> profile, suggesting that when youth are involved in these practices, then they are more likely to be highly engaged. In particular, given the makeup of this profile, this suggests that when youth are involved in these aspects of work with data, they are more likely to report high levels of cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and high perceptions of competence and challenge. Generating and modeling data may have such relations because they are particularly important aspects of work with data. As Lehrer and Schauble (2006) explain, <em>inscriptions serve commitments</em>: Choosing to record an observation or an idea as data involves the process of identifying something that is worth recording and then recording the parts that are of interest. Thus, generating data may be fully engaging to youth because it is, generally, demanding and important with respect to work with data. Modeling, too, is an important practice. It been described as <em>the</em> central scientific and engineering practice (Schwarz et al., 2009; Lehrer &amp; Schauble, 2015; Weisberg, 2012), and its relations with full engagement provides some actionable evidence for its importance in the context of summer STEM programs.</p>
<p>As there is no research on how work with data relates to youths’ engagement, the findings associated with this research question provide some (albeit limited) evidence, and directions for future research for how some aspects of work with data relate to youths’ engagement. As work with data is a core component of new visions for STEM learning (see the scientific and engineering practices that are part of the NGSS and the standards for mathematical practice in the CCSS), these findings provide some insight into how involvement in a subset (focused on work with data) of these practices relates to engagement. Particularly, the relatively minimal findings suggest that these activities may not be more engaging <em>per se</em>. Instead, it may be the way that youth engage in them that matters, in alignment with past research (Berland et al., 2017; Miller et al., in press).</p>
<p>While the findings for this question were somewhat minimal, there are key findings from both the important relationships that were found to be statistically significant (between generating data and data modeling and <em>Full</em> engagement) and from those that were not. Finding few significant findings may show that, in this sample and with work with data as carried out, it is difficult to say with certainty just how much of an impact work with data has upon youths’ engagement. This suggests that other samples, other enactments of work with data, and, possibly, other analytic approaches can build on this work to further substantiate what is known about how work with data is engaging to youth.</p>
<p>The relations between youth characteristics and the profiles were found to be small and not as much in line with expectations given the preliminary analysis. These small relations were similar (in magnitude) to those between work with data and the profiles, but they were more surprising for a reason related to the sample for this study, namely, given the substantial variability at the youth level among the responses. This is described in detail in the discussion of the findings for research question #3.</p>
<p>There was a lot of variability in the profiles of engagement at the youth level, but not many relations. Findings revealed that youth with higher pre-program interest were more likely to be <em>Engaged and competent but not challenged</em>. This suggests that youth with higher interest in STEM are inclined to be highly engaged and good at what they are doing, but are not challenged by the activities they experience. This finding is in line with past research suggesting a relationship (direct or as a moderator) between youth characteristics (including interest) and their engagement (Shernoff et al., 2003; Shernoff et al., 2016; Strati et al., 2017). More specifically, this finding suggests that for youth who are particularly interested (and those who choose to attend) summer STEM programs, what they are involved in may not challenge them very highly. This finding has implications for past research that shows youth who choose to attend summer STEM programs are more engaged (but that does not speak to their degree of challenge; Beymer, Rosenberg, Schmidt, &amp; Naftzger, 2018).</p>
<p>While the findings for this research question, like those for the relations between the aspects of work with data and youths’ engagement, they provide some information about how these characteristics relate to youths’ engagement. Finding that youth who are more interested prior to the beginning of the summer STEM programs are more likely to be working hard, learning something new, and enjoying what they are learning, and perceive themselves to be good at what they are doing but not challenged, is a meaningful finding. Moreover, the null findings suggest that other characteristics, including those measured but not included for this analysis (such as youths’ pre-program perceptions of their competence) as well as those not measured at all, may be considered in follow-up studies and in future research.</p>
<p>Why might these findings be so limited? One reason may be that summer STEM programs are different from other contexts in terms of work with data: While the programs that were involved in the study have many affordances for work with data and for being highly engaging for youth, they have some limitations, too, particularly with respect to support work with data. Importantly, these were not programs explicitly designed to support work with data; while such contexts are being developed, they are not yet widespread. Moreover, youth may perceive the programs to have lower stakes in terms of their future. This may mean that the individual activities that youth engage in is less connected to their engagement: Youth instead engage in typical (to each youth) ways, rather than in ways that are much more sensitive to changes in their context. Another possible explanation for these limited findings may be that youth are not very challenged or are not very supported: A profile with low challenge but high competence and cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement was found, suggesting that youth may be engaged and good at what they are doing, but are not challenged: Greater challenge may be found to be associated with more full engagement.</p>
<p>Learning environments that deliberately support work with data over a long period may demonstrate different patterns of engagement than those examined in this study because of the focus on and sequencing of the aspects of work with data, which may make it more (or less) cognitively, behaviorally, or affectively engaging than is determined in this study. As Miller et al. (2018) highlight, truly engaging STEM activities are not easily come by; they require students to take ownership over and to make decisions about their explorations or designs. Thus, future research may study work with data in contexts designed to support it. A key part of this future research may be studying both work with data and how work with data is supported (most importantly by the instructor but also by the curriculum and technological tools).</p>
