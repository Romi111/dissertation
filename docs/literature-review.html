<p>I define work with data as a key practice across STEM domains. I also describe a multi-dimensional approach to understanding engagement that considers engagement and the two influencers of engagement (perceptions of competence and challenge) and an approach to analyzing data from such an approach in order to establish the framework used in the present study.</p>
<div id="defining-work-with-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Defining Work With Data</h2>
<p>Some scholars have focused on a few key pieces of data analysis connected through the use of “data to solve real problems and to answer authentic questions” (Hancock et al., 1992, p. 337). This approach has primarily been taken up by mathematics educators and is reflected in statistics curriculum documents (Franklin et al., 2007). In science settings, where answering questions about phenomena serve as the focus of activities, it shares features of the process of engaging in scientific and engineering practices, but has been less often studied.</p>
<p>While work with data has been conceived in different ways (see Lee and Wikerson (in press) for a review and Wild and Pfannkuch (1999), Franklin et al. (2007), Lehrer and Schauble (2004) for specific examples from past research), some core components have emerged. Different approaches to working with data are distilled into five key aspects (see Figure 1) that guide their conceptualization in this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking questions: Generating questions that can be answered with empirical evidence</li>
<li>Making observations: Watching phenomena and noticing what is happening with respect to the phenomena or problem being investigated</li>
<li>Generating data: The process of figuring out how or why to inscribe an observation as data about a phenomena, as well as generating coding frames or tools for measuring</li>
<li>Data modeling: Activities involving use of simple statistics, such as the mean and variance, as well as more complicated models, such as linear models and extensions of the linear model</li>
<li>Interpreting and communicating findings: Activities related to identifying a driving question regarding the phenomena that the question is about</li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>
<p>The five practices are a cycle because not only does each part follow that before it, but also because the overall process is iterative: interpreting findings commonly leads to new questions and subsequent engagement in work with data. Also, scholars have pointed out some key features of how work with data is carried out that impact their effectiveness as a pedagogical approach. These key features include an emphasis on making sense of real-world phenomena and iterative cycles of engaging in work with data and collaboration and dialogue, through which ideas and intermediate findings are critiqued and subject to critique, and revised over time (McNeill &amp; Berland, 2017).</p>

<div id="the-role-of-work-with-data-in-the-curriculum" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The role of work with data in the curriculum</h2>
<p>Work with data can serve as an organizing set of practices for engaging in inquiry in STEM settings (Lehrer &amp; Schauble, 2015). Data are both encountered and generated by learners, and so opportunities for STEM students to work with data provide many opportunities to leverage students’ curiosity because processes of inquiry can be grounded in phenomena that learners themselves can see and manipulate or phenomena that learners are interested in. Also important, becoming proficient in work with data can provide learners with an in-demand capability in society, owing to the number of occupations, from education to entrepreneurship, that demand or involve taking action based on data (Wilkerson &amp; Fenwick, 2017). Furthermore, becoming proficient in work with data can be personally empowering because of the parts of our lives—from paying energy bills to interpreting news articles—that use data.</p>
<p>Recent reform efforts emphasize work with data (i.e., the scientific and engineering practices in the NGSS and the standards for mathematical practice in the Common Core State Standards). However, work with data is uncommon in many classroom settings (McNeill &amp; Berland, 2017), and so learning environments suited to engaging in work with data, but not explicitly designed to support it, may be valuable to study because they may serve as incubators of these rare and challenging learning activities.</p>
<p>Outside-of-school programs are a potentially valuable setting to explore engagement in work with data because of the combined pedagogical and technical expertise of their staff and the activities learners do during their participation in them. Staff for these programs includes educators and scientists, engineers, and others with the technical experience. Additionally, the programs were designed to involve learners in the types of real-world practices experienced by experts in STEM disciplines. Attendance in such programs is associated with many benefits to learners (Green, Lee, Constance, &amp; Hynes, 2013; see Lauer, Akiba, Wilkerson, Apthorp, Snow, &amp; Martin-Glenn, 2006, for a comprehensive review). These programs are also selected because little research has examined how data are part of the experiences of youth in out-of-school-time programs, despite its place as one of a few core practices in STEM. While these reasons to study work with data focus on outside-of-school programs, they are also germane to more formal learning environments, such as classrooms, in which teachers want to design opportunities for their learners to work with data. This is important even for those teachers who themselves have technical expertise, but who have experienced limited training and support for engaging learners in work with data. Therefore, these programs can provide insight into whether engaging in work with data is associated with more optimal forms of engagement in the conditions like those for classrooms in which engaging in work with data is a novel and potentially promising approach to doing and learning about STEM.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> What We Know (And Do Not Know) About How Youth Work with Data</h2>
<p>Scholars have researched cognitive capabilities related to work with data. Much of this laboratory-based research has focused on how children develop the capability to inductively reason from observations (Gelman &amp; Markman, 1987). Other research has focused on the development of causal, or mechanistic, reasoning, among young children (Gopnik et al., 2001; Gopnik &amp; Sobel, 2000), often from a Piagetian, individual-development focused tradition (i.e., Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1969). A key outcome of engaging in work with data has to do with how learners account for variability (Lehrer, Kim, &amp; Schauble, 2007; Petrosino, Lehrer, &amp; Schauble, 2003; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, &amp; Gupta, 2008; Lee, Angotti, &amp; Tarr, 2010), arguably the main goal of engaging in work with data (Konold &amp; Pollatsek, 2002). From this research, we know that learners can develop the capacity to reason about variability (and covariability).</p>
<p>Past research has also shown that there are strategies that can support work with data. These include the design of technological and the development of curricula. From this research, we know about specific strategies and learning progressions for learners to develop this capability, such as the role of measurement in exposing learners in a direct way to sources of variability (Petrosino et al., 2003), role of simulation to learn about sampling distributions (Stohl &amp; Tarr, 2002), and use of relevant phenomena, such as manufacturing processes, such as the size of metallic bolts, which can help learners to focus on “tracking a process by looking at its output” (Konold &amp; Pollatsek, 2002, p. 282).</p>
<p>Finally, past research has shown that different aspects of work with data pose unique opportunities and challenges. Asking empirical questions requires experience and ample time to ask a question that is both able to be answered with data and which is sustaining and worth investigating (Bielik, 2016; Hasson &amp; Yarden, 2012). Making observations and generating data, such as of the height of the school’s flagpole, requires negotiation not only of what to measure, but how and how many times to measure it (Lehrer, Kim, &amp; Schauble, 2007). Regarding modeling, not only teaching students about models, such as that of the mean, but also asking them to create them, are valuable and practical (Lehrer &amp; Schauble, 2004; Lehrer, Kim, &amp; Jones, 2011), but also time-intensive. Interpreting findings, especially in light of variability through models, and communicating answers to questions, means not only identifying error but understanding its sources, and can be supported through exploring models that deliberately represent the data poorly, but can be instructive for probing the benefits and weaknesses of models (Lee &amp; Hollebrands, 2008; Lehrer, Kim, &amp; Schauble, 2007).</p>
<p>Despite this past research, how learners participate in different aspects of work with data in terms of engagement theory has not been a focus of any past studies. Consider the process of structuring data, commonly described as a—or the—key part of many applied data analyses, that is also under-emphasized in students’ use of data in science settings in which students are provided already-processed, or plotted, data (McNeill &amp; Berland, 2017). How challenging do students perceive these activities to be? How to they perceive their competence regarding this activity? More importantly, how do they engage—cognitively, behaviorally, and affectively—during these experiences? Knowing more about these processes could help us to develop informed recommendations for teachers and designers intending to bring about opportunities for learners to engage in work with data in a better-supported way that is sustained over time.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Engagement in General and in STEM Domains</h2>
<p>The nature of engagement is discussed in terms of general features that have been identified across content area domains, conditions that support engagement, and differences between engagement in general and in STEM settings. This is followed by a discussion of two key features of engagement: its dynamic characteristics and what a person-oriented approach to its study can add to research about engagement and its impact on learning and other outcomes.</p>
<p>Engagement is defined in this study as active involvement, or investment, in activities (Blumenfeld et al., 2004). Explaining how learners are involved in activities and tasks is especially important if we want to know about what aspects of work with data are most engaging (and in what ways), and therefore can serve as exemplary for others advancing work with data as well as those calling for greater support for engagement. Apart from being focused on involvement, engagement is often thought of as a meta-construct, that is, one that is made up of other constructs (Skinner &amp; Pitzer, 2012; Skinner, Kindermann, &amp; Furrer, 2009). By defining engagement as a meta-construct, scholars characterize it in terms of cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions that are distinct yet interrelated (Fredricks, 2016). We know from past research that the cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of engagement can be distinguished (Wang &amp; Eccles, 2012; Wang &amp; Holcombe, 2012) and that while there are long-standing concerns about the conceptual breadth of engagement (Fredricks et al., 2016), careful justification and thoughtful use of multidimensional engagement constructs and measures is warranted based on past research. Engagement is also considered to be dynamic and changing in response to individual, situation or moment, and broader contextual factors, such as the family, classroom, or outside-of-school programs.</p>
<p>Engagement in STEM settings shares characteristics with engagement across disciplines, yet there are some distinct aspects of it (Greene, 2015). While one type of engagement—behavioral—is associated with positive outcomes, many STEM practices call for engagement in additional ways (Sinatra et al., 2015), especially around epistemic and agency-related dimensions. For example, many scholars have defined scientific and engineering practices as epistemic practices, which involve applying epistemic considerations around sources of evidence and the nature of explanatory processes (Berland et al., 2016; Stroupe, 2014). The emphasis on developing new knowledge and capabilities through engaging in STEM practices is a potentially important aspect. This is important because measures of engagement might need to be modified for use in STEM domains. Because of the importance of constructing knowledge to engagement in STEM practices, then, cognitive engagement is defined for this study in terms of learning something new or getting better at something. While sometimes defined in terms of extra-curricular involvement or following directions, behavioral engagement is defined in this study as working hard at and concentrating on learning-related activities (Fredricks et al., 2004; Singh, Granville, &amp; Dika, 2002). Finally, affective engagement is defined as affective responses to activities, such as being excited, angry, or relaxed (Pekrun &amp; Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2012).</p>

<div id="what-conditions-and-youth-characteristics-impact-engagement" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> What conditions and youth characteristics impact engagement</h2>
<p>Past research has shown that ESM can help us to find out what conditions support it. Past research suggests that not only learner-level characteristics, such as learners’ interest in the domain of study, but also dynamic, changing moment-to-moment conditions are also important (Shernoff et al., 2003; Shernoff et al., 2016; Shumow, Schmidt, &amp; Zaleski, 2013). Focusing on dynamic conditions, Emergent Motivation Theory (EMT; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), provides a useful lens. From EMT, a key momentary influencer of engagement is how difficult individuals perceive an activity to be, or its perceived challenge. Another key influencer is how good at an activity individuals perceive themselves to be, or their perceived competence. Most important, from the perspective of EMT, being challenged by and good at an activity are especially engaging experienced when together. Past research has supported this contention. Shernoff et al. (2016), for example, demonstrated that while challenge and skill with high levels of one but low levels on the other (i.e., high challenge and low skill) were not broadly associated with positive forms of engagement, their interaction was, suggesting that learners’ perceptions of the challenge of the activity, and their perceptions of how skillful they are, are important for explaining why learners engage.</p>
<p>Other key conditions that support engagement concern teacher support (Strati, Schmidt, &amp; Maier, 2017). Particularly concerning work with data, which is demanding not only for learners but also teachers, sustained support from teachers is an essential component of learners being able to work with data (Lehrer &amp; Schauble, 2015; Wilkerson, Andrews, Shaban, Laina, &amp; Gravel, 2016). Consequently, this study considers not only engagement, but also the conditions of engagement as part in terms of both learners’ subjective experiences. The conditions included in the PECs relate to learners’ subjective perceptions of two key factors suggested by past research and theory, in particular, how challenging they perceive the activity to be and how good at it they perceive themselves to be (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).</p>
<p>I review a few other youth characteristics that impact engagement. In recognition of differences among learners in their tendency to engage in different (higher or lower) ways in specific activities based in part on individual differences (Hidi &amp; Renninger, 2006), learners’ interest in STEM before the start of the programs is also considered as a factor that can impact engagement. Finally, gender and the racial and ethnic group of students is added, as past research has indicated these as factors that influence engagement in STEM (Bystydzienski, Eisenhart, &amp; Bruning; Shernoff &amp; Schmidt, 2008). These conditions are different from those discussed in the section on the five aspects of work with data in that they are teacher-related factors (with respect to instructional support), subjective factors (with respect to perceptions of challenge and competence), and demographic characteristics, whereas a focus on real-world phenomena, iterative cycles, and collaboration and dialogue may potentially impact engagement through learners’ perceiving the activity to be supported by the subjective contextual conditions of challenge and competence.</p>

<div id="using-esm-to-study-the-dynamics-of-engagement" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Using ESM to Study the Dynamics of Engagement</h2>
<p>A number of scholars, in recognition of the dynamic nature of engagement, have explored the use of Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to understand engagement (e.g., Strati et al., 2017)—or have recommended it is as a valuable approach for doing so (Turner &amp; Meyer, 2000; Sinatra et al., 2015). ESM involves asking—usually using a digital tool and occasionally a diary—to ask participants short questions about their experiences. ESM is particularly well-suited to understanding the dynamic nature of engagement because students answered brief surveys about their experience when they were signaled, minimally interrupting them from the activity they are engaged in and also seeking to collect measures about learners’ experience when signaled (Hektner, et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Research has shown us how the use of ESM can lead to distinct research contributions. Shernoff, Csikszentmihalyi, Schneider, and Shernoff (2003) examined engagement through the use of measures aligned with flow theory, namely, using measures of concentration, interest, and enjoyment (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). In a study using the same measures of engagement (concentration, interest, and enjoyment) Shernoff et al. (2016) used an observational measure of challenge and control (or environmental complexity) and found that it significantly predicted engagement, as well as self-esteem, intrinsic motivation, and academic intensity. Schneider et al. (2016) and Linnansaari et al. (2015) examined features of optimal learning moments or moments in which students report high levels of interest, skill, and challenge, as well as their antecedents and consequences. Similar to ESM in that through its use engagement can be studied in a more context-sensitive, still other scholars have used daily diary studies to examine engagement as a function of autonomy-supportive classroom practices (Patall, Vasquez, Steingut, Trimble, &amp; Pituch, 2015; Patall, Steingut, Vasquez, Trimble, &amp; Freeman, 2017). This past research that used ESM (or daily diary studies) to study engagement has shown us that the methodological approach can be used to answer questions that were hard to answer using the more-traditional pre- or post-survey measures.</p>
<p>Other research shows us that there are newer approaches to analyzing ESM data that can contribute insights into the dynamics of engagement in a more fine-grained way. For example, Strati et al. (2017) explored the relations between engagement to measures of teacher support, finding associations between instrumental support and engagement and powerfully demonstrating the capacity of ESM to understand some of the dynamics of engagement. Similarly, Poysa et al. (2017) used a similar data analytic approach as Strati et al. (2017), that is, use of crossed effects models for variation within both students and time points, both within and between days. These studies establish the value of the use of ESM to understand the dynamics of engagement and that such an approach may be able to be used to understand engaging in work with data. Additionally, these studies show that how effects at different levels are treated, namely, how variability at these levels is accounted for through random effects as part of mixed effects models, is a key practical consideration for analysts of ESM data.</p>

<div id="the-benefit-of-profiles-of-engagement-and-the-conditions-of-engagement-perceptions-of-challenge-and-competence" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> The benefit of profiles of engagement and the conditions of engagement (perceptions of challenge and competence)</h2>
<p>One powerful and increasingly widely used way to examine dynamic constructs holistically is a person-oriented approach, which can be used to consider the way in which psychological constructs are experienced together and at once in the experiences of learners. In the context of the present study, this approach can help us to identify naturally occurring profiles of momentary engagement, or engagement as reported by youth via ESM during particular moments. Note that ESM involves asking youth about to report on their experience at the time they were signaled.</p>
<p>Profiles seek to capture both the cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of engagement and the subjective conditions of challenge and competence to understand how students experience engagement and its conditions in a more holistic way. There are some recent studies taking a person-oriented approach to the study of engagement (i.e., Salmela-Aro, Moeller, Schneider, Spicer, &amp; Lavonen, 2016a; Salmela-Aro, Muotka, Alho, Hakkarainen, &amp; Lonka, 2016b; Van Rooij, Jansen, &amp; van de Grift, 2017; Schmidt, Rosenberg, &amp; Beymer, 2018), though none have done so to study youths’ engagement in work with data.</p>
<p>The person-oriented approach has an important implication for how we analyze data collected from ESM about youths’ engagement, in particular when we consider how to understand engagement as a meta-construct (Skinner, Kindermann, &amp; Furrer, 2009) and how to account for its dynamic nature (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). We know from past research that engagement can be explained in terms of different patterns among its individual components (Bergman &amp; Magnusson, 1997), in the present case its cognitive, behavioral, and affective components. Because learners’ engagement includes cognitive, behavioral, and affective aspects experienced together at the same time, it can be experienced as a combined effect that is categorically distinct from the effects of the individual dimensions of engagement. This combined effect can be considered as profiles of engagement. Past studies have considered profiles of cognitive, behavioral, and affective aspects of engagement.</p>
<p>To account for the dynamic nature of engagement, some past studies have used other measures to predict engagement, such as use of in-the-moment resources and demands (Salmela-Aro et al., 2016b) or, in the case of the study reviewed in the previous section, use of instructional activities and choice (Schmidt et al., 2018). Different from this past research, another potential way to account for the dynamics of engagement is to consider both engagement and its conditions at once. Since a person-oriented approach emphasizes the dynamic nature of development and the impact of not only external but also intra-individual factors. As in the present study, youths’ perceptions of challenge and competence, also collected via ESM, are used along with the measures of engagement to construct momentary profiles. Thus, the profiles of engagement can be considered to be profiles of engagement and its conditions, as they include youths’ responses to five ESM items for their cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and their perceptions of how challenging the activity they were doing is and of how competent at the activity they are.</p>
</div>
<div id="need-for-the-present-study" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Need for the Present Study</h2>
<p>While many scholars have argued that work with data can be understood in terms of the capabilities learners develop and the outcome learners achieve, there is a need to better understand learners’ experiences working with data. The present study does this through the use of contemporary engagement theory and innovative methodological and analytic approaches. Doing this can help us to understand work with data in terms of learner’s experience, which we know from past research impacts what and how students learn (Sinatra et al., 2015). Knowing more about students’ engagement can help us to design activities and interventions focused around work with data that are more engaging and which provide more support to learners in terms of their perceptions of challenge and their own competence. In addition to this general need to study engagement in work with data through the lens of engagement, no research that I am aware of has examined work with data or data analysis more generally in the context of outside-of-school programs. These settings are potentially rich with opportunities for highly engaged learners to analyze authentic data sources. Finally, little research has examined how data is part of the experiences of youth in out-of-school-time programs, despite its place as one of a few core practices in STEM.</p>

<div id="conceptual-framework-and-research-questions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Conceptual Framework and Research Questions</h2>
<p>The present study is about how engagement can be used to understand how learners are involved in work with data and how characteristics of activities and learners impact the relationships between work with data and engagement. Its context is out-of-school-time STEM enrichment programs designed to meet guidelines for best practices. The conceptual framework in the present study is presented in Figure 2 and is unpacked in the remainder of this section.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>

Figure 2.2: A conceptual framework for this study with research questions labeled
</p>
</div>
<p>There are five aspects of work with data synthesized from past research (i.e., Hancock et al., 1992; Lehrer &amp; Romberg, 1996; Wild &amp; Pfannkuch, 1999):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Asking questions or identifying problems</li>
<li>Making observations</li>
<li>Generating data</li>
<li>Data modeling</li>
<li>Interpreting and communicating findings</li>
</ol>
<p>In Figure 2, engagement in work with data is associated with different profiles of engagement and its conditions, referred to as either profiles of engagement and its conditions or profiles in the remainder of this manuscript. The theoretical framework for the person-oriented approach suggests that while the dynamics among the individual aspects of engagement emerge in complex and situation-specific ways, it is possible to consider engagement in terms of patterns among its components. In addition, a pre-program measure of learners’ individual interest in STEM is hypothesized to be associated with the profiles and the relations of work with data and the profiles. The ESM responses that make up the profiles are associated with students, moments, and program effects that must be accounted for (Strati et al., 2017).</p>
<p>As depicted in the Figure 2, the four research questions are formalized as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the frequency and nature of opportunities for youth to engage in each of the five aspects of work with data in summer STEM programs?</li>
<li>What profiles of youth engagement and its conditions emerge from experiential data collected in the programs?</li>
<li>How do data practices relate to youth engagement in the programs?</li>
<li>How do youth characteristics relate to their engagement?</li>
</ol>
