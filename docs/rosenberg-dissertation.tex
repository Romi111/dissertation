\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro-placemarker}

Changes in how we plan our day-to-day lives, communicate, and learn are
increasingly impacted by data. These sources of data--quantitative and
qualitative--are created by us, for us, and about us, although at
present opportunities for learners to analyze data in educational
settings remain limited. Work with data more broadly includes processes
of collecting, creating, modeling data, and asking questions that may be
answered with data and making sense of findings.

Work with data, then, is more than just crunching numbers or
interpreting a figure created by someone else, but rather is about
making sense of phenomena and problem solving, a point particularly
relevant to work with data in educational contexts (Lee \& Wilkerson,
2018; Wild \& Pfannkuch, 1999). Aspects of work with data cut across
STEM domains and are recognized as core competencies in both the Next
Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards
(National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, Council of
Chief State School Officers, 2010; NGSS Lead States, 2013). Scholars
have pointed out the benefits of analyzing data for learners as young as
two years old (Gopnik, \& Sobel, 2000).

In supporting teachers and learners' data analysis efforts, some
scholars have focused on key data analytic processes, particularly those
related to generating measures of phenomena and creating data models,
using these as anchoring practices for other aspects of work with data,
like posing questions (English, 2012; Lehrer \& Romberg, 1996; Lesh,
Middleton, Caylor, \& Gupta, 2008). Findings from this area of research
suggest that engaging in these practices ``has an exceptionally high
payoff in terms of students' scientific reasoning'' (Lehrer \& Schauble,
2015, p.~696) and can highlight the utility of mathematics for students'
lives (Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, \& Gupta, 2008).

Learners' experiences, considered from the perspective of engagement
theory, consist not only of cognitive processes, but also behavioral and
even affective dimensions, too (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, \& Paris, 2004;
Skinner \& Pitzer, 2012). When learners' experiences are considered in
terms of their engagement, we can hypothesize that learners who are
engaged in high-quality activities related to work with data will be
more or less cognitively, behaviorally, and affectively engaged. This
engagement is a key outcome in its own right and may be an antecedent of
changes in other outcomes, such as students' intention to pursue an area
of study or career in a STEM domain.

While scholars have looked at cognitive outcomes and learners'
capability to participate in specific, learners' experiences of working
with data has not been the focus of past research. Thus, the present
study sets out to understand to how learners' experiences are impacted
by work with data. In this study, I use contemporary engagement theory
as a framework to understand learners' experience. Past research has
shown that how engaged learners and youth are is a predictor of key
outcomes, such as their well-being, achievement and pursuit of an area
of study or career (Sinatra, Heddy, \& Lombardi, 2015; Wang, Chow,
Hofkens, \& Salmela-Aro, 2015; Wang \& Eccles, 2012).

In this framework, engagement is considered to multi-dimensional and
dynamic, or changing over time (Fredricks \& McColskey, 2012). Scholars
commonly consider engagement in terms of three dimensions: cognitive
(i.e., use of meta-cognitive learning strategies), behavioral (hard work
on a task), and affective dimensions (enjoyment; Fredricks, Blumenfeld,
\& Paris, 2004; Sinatra, et al., 2015; Skinner \& Pitzer, 2012). In
recognition of its dynamic nature, some engagement scholars have drawn
upon flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, 1997) to identify not only
dimensions of engagement, but also other, subjective, characteristics
that effect engagement. This past research, drawn upon in the present
study, has considered two of learners' subjective considerations, their
perceived competence and challenge, act as key conditions of engagement
(Shernoff, Kelly, Tonks, Anderson, Cavanagh, Sinha, \& Abdi, 2016).

The purpose of this study, then, is to understand learners' experience
of working with data through the lens of engagement. Engagement is
understood in terms of cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions,
and the conditions that support engagement are understood in terms of
two subjective components that past research and theory suggest
influence engagement: perceived challenge and perceived competence. Work
with data is considered in terms of specific aspects, such as asking
questions and generating and modeling data, identified from past
research. Engagement in work with data is explored in the context of
outside-of-school STEM enrichment programs carried out during the
summer.

\chapter{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

I define work with data as a key practice across STEM domains. I also
describe a multi-dimensional approach to understanding engagement that
considers engagement and the two influencers of engagement (perceptions
of competence and challenge) and an approach to analyzing data from such
an approach in order to establish the framework used in the present
study.

\section{Defining Work With Data}\label{defining-work-with-data}

Some scholars have focused on a few key pieces of data analysis
connected through the use of ``data to solve real problems and to answer
authentic questions'' (Hancock et al., 1992, p.~337). This approach has
primarily been taken up by mathematics educators and is reflected in
statistics curriculum documents (Franklin et al., 2007). In science
settings, where answering questions about phenomena serve as the focus
of activities, it shares features of the process of engaging in
scientific and engineering practices, but has been less often studied.

While work with data has been conceived in different ways (see Lee and
Wikerson (in press) for a review and Wild and Pfannkuch (1999), Franklin
et al. (2007), Lehrer and Schauble (2004) for specific examples from
past research), some core components have emerged. Different approaches
to working with data are distilled into five key aspects (see Figure 1)
that guide their conceptualization in this study:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Asking questions: Generating questions that can be answered with
  empirical evidence
\item
  Making observations: Watching phenomena and noticing what is happening
  with respect to the phenomena or problem being investigated
\item
  Generating data: The process of figuring out how or why to inscribe an
  observation as data about a phenomena, as well as generating coding
  frames or tools for measuring
\item
  Data modeling: Activities involving use of simple statistics, such as
  the mean and variance, as well as more complicated models, such as
  linear models and extensions of the linear model
\item
  Interpreting and communicating findings: Activities related to
  identifying a driving question regarding the phenomena that the
  question is about
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/figure1} 

}

\caption{Work with data in STEM education settings}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

The five practices are a cycle because not only does each part follow
that before it, but also because the overall process is iterative:
interpreting findings commonly leads to new questions and subsequent
engagement in work with data. Also, scholars have pointed out some key
features of how work with data is carried out that impact their
effectiveness as a pedagogical approach. These key features include an
emphasis on making sense of real-world phenomena and iterative cycles of
engaging in work with data and collaboration and dialogue, through which
ideas and intermediate findings are critiqued and subject to critique,
and revised over time (McNeill \& Berland, 2017).

\section{The role of work with data in the
curriculum}\label{the-role-of-work-with-data-in-the-curriculum}

Work with data can serve as an organizing set of practices for engaging
in inquiry in STEM settings (Lehrer \& Schauble, 2015). Data are both
encountered and generated by learners, and so opportunities for STEM
students to work with data provide many opportunities to leverage
students' curiosity because processes of inquiry can be grounded in
phenomena that learners themselves can see and manipulate or phenomena
that learners are interested in. Also important, becoming proficient in
work with data can provide learners with an in-demand capability in
society, owing to the number of occupations, from education to
entrepreneurship, that demand or involve taking action based on data
(Wilkerson \& Fenwick, 2017). Furthermore, becoming proficient in work
with data can be personally empowering because of the parts of our
lives---from paying energy bills to interpreting news articles---that
use data.

Recent reform efforts emphasize work with data (i.e., the scientific and
engineering practices in the NGSS and the standards for mathematical
practice in the Common Core State Standards). However, work with data is
uncommon in many classroom settings (McNeill \& Berland, 2017), and so
learning environments suited to engaging in work with data, but not
explicitly designed to support it, may be valuable to study because they
may serve as incubators of these rare and challenging learning
activities.

Outside-of-school programs are a potentially valuable setting to explore
engagement in work with data because of the combined pedagogical and
technical expertise of their staff and the activities learners do during
their participation in them. Staff for these programs includes educators
and scientists, engineers, and others with the technical experience.
Additionally, the programs were designed to involve learners in the
types of real-world practices experienced by experts in STEM
disciplines. Attendance in such programs is associated with many
benefits to learners (Green, Lee, Constance, \& Hynes, 2013; see Lauer,
Akiba, Wilkerson, Apthorp, Snow, \& Martin-Glenn, 2006, for a
comprehensive review). These programs are also selected because little
research has examined how data are part of the experiences of youth in
out-of-school-time programs, despite its place as one of a few core
practices in STEM. While these reasons to study work with data focus on
outside-of-school programs, they are also germane to more formal
learning environments, such as classrooms, in which teachers want to
design opportunities for their learners to work with data. This is
important even for those teachers who themselves have technical
expertise, but who have experienced limited training and support for
engaging learners in work with data. Therefore, these programs can
provide insight into whether engaging in work with data is associated
with more optimal forms of engagement in the conditions like those for
classrooms in which engaging in work with data is a novel and
potentially promising approach to doing and learning about STEM.

\section{What We Know (And Do Not Know) About How Youth Work with
Data}\label{what-we-know-and-do-not-know-about-how-youth-work-with-data}

Scholars have researched cognitive capabilities related to work with
data. Much of this laboratory-based research has focused on how children
develop the capability to inductively reason from observations (Gelman
\& Markman, 1987). Other research has focused on the development of
causal, or mechanistic, reasoning, among young children (Gopnik et al.,
2001; Gopnik \& Sobel, 2000), often from a Piagetian,
individual-development focused tradition (i.e., Piaget \& Inhelder,
1969). A key outcome of engaging in work with data has to do with how
learners account for variability (Lehrer, Kim, \& Schauble, 2007;
Petrosino, Lehrer, \& Schauble, 2003; Lesh, Middleton, Caylor, \& Gupta,
2008; Lee, Angotti, \& Tarr, 2010), arguably the main goal of engaging
in work with data (Konold \& Pollatsek, 2002). From this research, we
know that learners can develop the capacity to reason about variability
(and covariability).

Past research has also shown that there are strategies that can support
work with data. These include the design of technological and the
development of curricula. From this research, we know about specific
strategies and learning progressions for learners to develop this
capability, such as the role of measurement in exposing learners in a
direct way to sources of variability (Petrosino et al., 2003), role of
simulation to learn about sampling distributions (Stohl \& Tarr, 2002),
and use of relevant phenomena, such as manufacturing processes, such as
the size of metallic bolts, which can help learners to focus on
``tracking a process by looking at its output'' (Konold \& Pollatsek,
2002, p.~282).

Finally, past research has shown that different aspects of work with
data pose unique opportunities and challenges. Asking empirical
questions requires experience and ample time to ask a question that is
both able to be answered with data and which is sustaining and worth
investigating (Bielik, 2016; Hasson \& Yarden, 2012). Making
observations and generating data, such as of the height of the school's
flagpole, requires negotiation not only of what to measure, but how and
how many times to measure it (Lehrer, Kim, \& Schauble, 2007). Regarding
modeling, not only teaching students about models, such as that of the
mean, but also asking them to create them, are valuable and practical
(Lehrer \& Schauble, 2004; Lehrer, Kim, \& Jones, 2011), but also
time-intensive. Interpreting findings, especially in light of
variability through models, and communicating answers to questions,
means not only identifying error but understanding its sources, and can
be supported through exploring models that deliberately represent the
data poorly, but can be instructive for probing the benefits and
weaknesses of models (Lee \& Hollebrands, 2008; Lehrer, Kim, \&
Schauble, 2007).

Despite this past research, how learners participate in different
aspects of work with data in terms of engagement theory has not been a
focus of any past studies. Consider the process of structuring data,
commonly described as a---or the---key part of many applied data
analyses, that is also under-emphasized in students' use of data in
science settings in which students are provided already-processed, or
plotted, data (McNeill \& Berland, 2017). How challenging do students
perceive these activities to be? How to they perceive their competence
regarding this activity? More importantly, how do they
engage---cognitively, behaviorally, and affectively---during these
experiences? Knowing more about these processes could help us to develop
informed recommendations for teachers and designers intending to bring
about opportunities for learners to engage in work with data in a
better-supported way that is sustained over time.

\section{Engagement in General and in STEM
Domains}\label{engagement-in-general-and-in-stem-domains}

The nature of engagement is discussed in terms of general features that
have been identified across content area domains, conditions that
support engagement, and differences between engagement in general and in
STEM settings. This is followed by a discussion of two key features of
engagement: its dynamic characteristics and what a person-oriented
approach to its study can add to research about engagement and its
impact on learning and other outcomes.

Engagement is defined in this study as active involvement, or
investment, in activities (Blumenfeld et al., 2004). Explaining how
learners are involved in activities and tasks is especially important if
we want to know about what aspects of work with data are most engaging
(and in what ways), and therefore can serve as exemplary for others
advancing work with data as well as those calling for greater support
for engagement. Apart from being focused on involvement, engagement is
often thought of as a meta-construct, that is, one that is made up of
other constructs (Skinner \& Pitzer, 2012; Skinner, Kindermann, \&
Furrer, 2009). By defining engagement as a meta-construct, scholars
characterize it in terms of cognitive, behavioral, and affective
dimensions that are distinct yet interrelated (Fredricks, 2016). We know
from past research that the cognitive, behavioral, and affective
dimensions of engagement can be distinguished (Wang \& Eccles, 2012;
Wang \& Holcombe, 2012) and that while there are long-standing concerns
about the conceptual breadth of engagement (Fredricks et al., 2016),
careful justification and thoughtful use of multidimensional engagement
constructs and measures is warranted based on past research. Engagement
is also considered to be dynamic and changing in response to individual,
situation or moment, and broader contextual factors, such as the family,
classroom, or outside-of-school programs.

Engagement in STEM settings shares characteristics with engagement
across disciplines, yet there are some distinct aspects of it (Greene,
2015). While one type of engagement---behavioral---is associated with
positive outcomes, many STEM practices call for engagement in additional
ways (Sinatra et al., 2015), especially around epistemic and
agency-related dimensions. For example, many scholars have defined
scientific and engineering practices as epistemic practices, which
involve applying epistemic considerations around sources of evidence and
the nature of explanatory processes (Berland et al., 2016; Stroupe,
2014). The emphasis on developing new knowledge and capabilities through
engaging in STEM practices is a potentially important aspect. This is
important because measures of engagement might need to be modified for
use in STEM domains. Because of the importance of constructing knowledge
to engagement in STEM practices, then, cognitive engagement is defined
for this study in terms of learning something new or getting better at
something. While sometimes defined in terms of extra-curricular
involvement or following directions, behavioral engagement is defined in
this study as working hard at and concentrating on learning-related
activities (Fredricks et al., 2004; Singh, Granville, \& Dika, 2002).
Finally, affective engagement is defined as affective responses to
activities, such as being excited, angry, or relaxed (Pekrun \&
Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2012).

\section{What conditions and youth characteristics impact
engagement}\label{what-conditions-and-youth-characteristics-impact-engagement}

Past research has shown that ESM can help us to find out what conditions
support it. Past research suggests that not only learner-level
characteristics, such as learners' interest in the domain of study, but
also dynamic, changing moment-to-moment conditions are also important
(Shernoff et al., 2003; Shernoff et al., 2016; Shumow, Schmidt, \&
Zaleski, 2013). Focusing on dynamic conditions, Emergent Motivation
Theory (EMT; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), provides a useful lens. From EMT,
a key momentary influencer of engagement is how difficult individuals
perceive an activity to be, or its perceived challenge. Another key
influencer is how good at an activity individuals perceive themselves to
be, or their perceived competence. Most important, from the perspective
of EMT, being challenged by and good at an activity are especially
engaging experienced when together. Past research has supported this
contention. Shernoff et al. (2016), for example, demonstrated that while
challenge and skill with high levels of one but low levels on the other
(i.e., high challenge and low skill) were not broadly associated with
positive forms of engagement, their interaction was, suggesting that
learners' perceptions of the challenge of the activity, and their
perceptions of how skillful they are, are important for explaining why
learners engage.

Other key conditions that support engagement concern teacher support
(Strati, Schmidt, \& Maier, 2017). Particularly concerning work with
data, which is demanding not only for learners but also teachers,
sustained support from teachers is an essential component of learners
being able to work with data (Lehrer \& Schauble, 2015; Wilkerson,
Andrews, Shaban, Laina, \& Gravel, 2016). Consequently, this study
considers not only engagement, but also the conditions of engagement as
part in terms of both learners' subjective experiences. The conditions
included in the PECs relate to learners' subjective perceptions of two
key factors suggested by past research and theory, in particular, how
challenging they perceive the activity to be and how good at it they
perceive themselves to be (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).

I review a few other youth characteristics that impact engagement. In
recognition of differences among learners in their tendency to engage in
different (higher or lower) ways in specific activities based in part on
individual differences (Hidi \& Renninger, 2006), learners' interest in
STEM before the start of the programs is also considered as a factor
that can impact engagement. Finally, gender and the racial and ethnic
group of students is added, as past research has indicated these as
factors that influence engagement in STEM (Bystydzienski, Eisenhart, \&
Bruning; Shernoff \& Schmidt, 2008). These conditions are different from
those discussed in the section on the five aspects of work with data in
that they are teacher-related factors (with respect to instructional
support), subjective factors (with respect to perceptions of challenge
and competence), and demographic characteristics, whereas a focus on
real-world phenomena, iterative cycles, and collaboration and dialogue
may potentially impact engagement through learners' perceiving the
activity to be supported by the subjective contextual conditions of
challenge and competence.

\section{Using ESM to Study the Dynamics of
Engagement}\label{using-esm-to-study-the-dynamics-of-engagement}

A number of scholars, in recognition of the dynamic nature of
engagement, have explored the use of Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to
understand engagement (e.g., Strati et al., 2017)---or have recommended
it is as a valuable approach for doing so (Turner \& Meyer, 2000;
Sinatra et al., 2015). ESM involves asking---usually using a digital
tool and occasionally a diary---to ask participants short questions
about their experiences. ESM is particularly well-suited to
understanding the dynamic nature of engagement because students answered
brief surveys about their experience when they were signaled, minimally
interrupting them from the activity they are engaged in and also seeking
to collect measures about learners' experience when signaled (Hektner,
et al., 2007).

Research has shown us how the use of ESM can lead to distinct research
contributions. Shernoff, Csikszentmihalyi, Schneider, and Shernoff
(2003) examined engagement through the use of measures aligned with flow
theory, namely, using measures of concentration, interest, and enjoyment
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). In a study using the same measures of
engagement (concentration, interest, and enjoyment) Shernoff et al.
(2016) used an observational measure of challenge and control (or
environmental complexity) and found that it significantly predicted
engagement, as well as self-esteem, intrinsic motivation, and academic
intensity. Schneider et al. (2016) and Linnansaari et al. (2015)
examined features of optimal learning moments or moments in which
students report high levels of interest, skill, and challenge, as well
as their antecedents and consequences. Similar to ESM in that through
its use engagement can be studied in a more context-sensitive, still
other scholars have used daily diary studies to examine engagement as a
function of autonomy-supportive classroom practices (Patall, Vasquez,
Steingut, Trimble, \& Pituch, 2015; Patall, Steingut, Vasquez, Trimble,
\& Freeman, 2017). This past research that used ESM (or daily diary
studies) to study engagement has shown us that the methodological
approach can be used to answer questions that were hard to answer using
the more-traditional pre- or post-survey measures.

Other research shows us that there are newer approaches to analyzing ESM
data that can contribute insights into the dynamics of engagement in a
more fine-grained way. For example, Strati et al. (2017) explored the
relations between engagement to measures of teacher support, finding
associations between instrumental support and engagement and powerfully
demonstrating the capacity of ESM to understand some of the dynamics of
engagement. Similarly, Poysa et al. (2017) used a similar data analytic
approach as Strati et al. (2017), that is, use of crossed effects models
for variation within both students and time points, both within and
between days. These studies establish the value of the use of ESM to
understand the dynamics of engagement and that such an approach may be
able to be used to understand engaging in work with data. Additionally,
these studies show that how effects at different levels are treated,
namely, how variability at these levels is accounted for through random
effects as part of mixed effects models, is a key practical
consideration for analysts of ESM data.

\section{The benefit of profiles of engagement and the conditions of
engagement (perceptions of challenge and
competence)}\label{the-benefit-of-profiles-of-engagement-and-the-conditions-of-engagement-perceptions-of-challenge-and-competence}

One powerful and increasingly widely used way to examine dynamic
constructs holistically is a person-oriented approach, which can be used
to consider the way in which psychological constructs are experienced
together and at once in the experiences of learners. In the context of
the present study, this approach can help us to identify naturally
occurring profiles of momentary engagement, or engagement as reported by
youth via ESM during particular moments. Note that ESM involves asking
youth about to report on their experience at the time they were
signaled.

Profiles seek to capture both the cognitive, behavioral, and affective
dimensions of engagement and the subjective conditions of challenge and
competence to understand how students experience engagement and its
conditions in a more holistic way. There are some recent studies taking
a person-oriented approach to the study of engagement (i.e.,
Salmela-Aro, Moeller, Schneider, Spicer, \& Lavonen, 2016a; Salmela-Aro,
Muotka, Alho, Hakkarainen, \& Lonka, 2016b; Van Rooij, Jansen, \& van de
Grift, 2017; Schmidt, Rosenberg, \& Beymer, 2018), though none have done
so to study youths' engagement in work with data.

The person-oriented approach has an important implication for how we
analyze data collected from ESM about youths' engagement, in particular
when we consider how to understand engagement as a meta-construct
(Skinner, Kindermann, \& Furrer, 2009) and how to account for its
dynamic nature (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). We know from past research that
engagement can be explained in terms of different patterns among its
individual components (Bergman \& Magnusson, 1997), in the present case
its cognitive, behavioral, and affective components. Because learners'
engagement includes cognitive, behavioral, and affective aspects
experienced together at the same time, it can be experienced as a
combined effect that is categorically distinct from the effects of the
individual dimensions of engagement. This combined effect can be
considered as profiles of engagement. Past studies have considered
profiles of cognitive, behavioral, and affective aspects of engagement.

To account for the dynamic nature of engagement, some past studies have
used other measures to predict engagement, such as use of in-the-moment
resources and demands (Salmela-Aro et al., 2016b) or, in the case of the
study reviewed in the previous section, use of instructional activities
and choice (Schmidt et al., 2018). Different from this past research,
another potential way to account for the dynamics of engagement is to
consider both engagement and its conditions at once. Since a
person-oriented approach emphasizes the dynamic nature of development
and the impact of not only external but also intra-individual factors.
As in the present study, youths' perceptions of challenge and
competence, also collected via ESM, are used along with the measures of
engagement to construct momentary profiles. Thus, the profiles of
engagement can be considered to be profiles of engagement and its
conditions, as they include youths' responses to five ESM items for
their cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and their
perceptions of how challenging the activity they were doing is and of
how competent at the activity they are.

\section{Need for the Present Study}\label{need-for-the-present-study}

While many scholars have argued that work with data can be understood in
terms of the capabilities learners develop and the outcome learners
achieve, there is a need to better understand learners' experiences
working with data. The present study does this through the use of
contemporary engagement theory and innovative methodological and
analytic approaches. Doing this can help us to understand work with data
in terms of learner's experience, which we know from past research
impacts what and how students learn (Sinatra et al., 2015). Knowing more
about students' engagement can help us to design activities and
interventions focused around work with data that are more engaging and
which provide more support to learners in terms of their perceptions of
challenge and their own competence. In addition to this general need to
study engagement in work with data through the lens of engagement, no
research that I am aware of has examined work with data or data analysis
more generally in the context of outside-of-school programs. These
settings are potentially rich with opportunities for highly engaged
learners to analyze authentic data sources. Finally, little research has
examined how data is part of the experiences of youth in
out-of-school-time programs, despite its place as one of a few core
practices in STEM.

\section{Conceptual Framework and Research
Questions}\label{conceptual-framework-and-research-questions}

The present study is about how engagement can be used to understand how
learners are involved in work with data and how characteristics of
activities and learners impact the relationships between work with data
and engagement. Its context is out-of-school-time STEM enrichment
programs designed to meet guidelines for best practices. The conceptual
framework in the present study is presented in Figure 2 and is unpacked
in the remainder of this section.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/figure2} 

}

\caption{A conceptual framework for this study with research questions labeled}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

There are five aspects of work with data synthesized from past research
(i.e., Hancock et al., 1992; Lehrer \& Romberg, 1996; Wild \& Pfannkuch,
1999):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Asking questions or identifying problems
\item
  Making observations
\item
  Generating data
\item
  Data modeling
\item
  Interpreting and communicating findings
\end{enumerate}

In Figure 2, engagement in work with data is associated with different
profiles of engagement and its conditions, referred to as either
profiles of engagement and its conditions or profiles in the remainder
of this manuscript. The theoretical framework for the person-oriented
approach suggests that while the dynamics among the individual aspects
of engagement emerge in complex and situation-specific ways, it is
possible to consider engagement in terms of patterns among its
components. In addition, a pre-program measure of learners' individual
interest in STEM is hypothesized to be associated with the profiles and
the relations of work with data and the profiles. The ESM responses that
make up the profiles are associated with students, moments, and program
effects that must be accounted for (Strati et al., 2017).

As depicted in the Figure 2, the four research questions are formalized
as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the frequency and nature of opportunities for youth to engage
  in each of the five aspects of work with data in summer STEM programs?
\item
  What profiles of youth engagement and its conditions emerge from
  experiential data collected in the programs?
\item
  How do data practices relate to youth engagement in the programs?
\item
  How do youth characteristics relate to their engagement?
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Method}\label{method}

In recognition of the challenge of studying engagement in learning
environments where factors related to activities, learners, and each of
the nine programs all interact at the same time, this study uses a
methodological approach suited to studying engagement as a dynamic,
multi-faceted experience. Specifically, this study employs the
Experience Sampling Method (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, \& Csikszentmihalyi,
2007) where learners answer short questions about their experience when
signaled. This approach is both sensitive to changes in engagement over
time, as well as between learners and allows us to understand engagement
and how factors impact it in more nuanced and complex ways (Turner \&
Meyer, 2000).

\section{Participants}\label{participants}

Participants consist of 203 youth. Youth in these programs are from
diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (see Table 1). Most participants
are around 13 years old (from youth whose age was available: \emph{M} =
12.71, \emph{SD} = 1.70, \emph{min.} = 10.75, \emph{max.} = 16.36).
Detailed demographic characteristics of learners are presented in the
table.

\section{Context}\label{context}

The setting for this study is nine out-of-school STEM programs designed
around best practices in urban areas in the Northeast United States
during the summer of 2015. These are described in the appendix with
pseudonyms for the program names. Two intermediary organizations
contracted by the urban area school districts to administer the summer
programs. The two intermediaries were responsible for soliciting and
enrolling youth; establishing guidelines for the design of the programs,
and the goals of the programs; and provide training and professional
development for the program's staff. A key difference between the
intermediary organizations was that one separated academic and
enrichment-related activities, whereas, in another, which was more
closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the program, the
academic and enrichment components were more integrated, which may have
program-specific effects on learners' engagement. Many of the programs
aim to involve learners in work with data. These learning environments
bring together youth activity leaders, educators, and those with
technical expertise in STEM domains. Youth spent around three hours per
day for four days per week for the approximately four-week programs,
which were taught by youth activity leaders and scientists, engineers,
and other community members with technical expertise.

\section{Procedure}\label{procedure}

Youth completed a pre-survey before the program. Youth also completed
pre-course surveys of their experience in STEM, intention to pursue a
STEM major or career, and questions for other motivation and
engagement-related measures. At the beginning of the programs, youth
were introduced to the study and the phones used for data collection
related to the ESM. ESM data were collected two days each week, for
three weeks (weeks 2-4 of the program). In all of the programs, about
equal video-recording time was dedicated to classroom and field
experiences. This detail is important because programs associated with
one of the intermediaries rotated between classroom and field experience
days, while the other used the first half of each day for one (i.e.,
classroom activities) or the other (i.e., field experience days).

Each day, youth were signaled four times. These signals were at the same
time for all of the youth within their program, but at different times
between programs and between days within programs (with the constraint
that no two signals could occur less than ten minutes apart). All of the
programs were video-recorded by research team members and on three
occasions research team members also recorded detailed field notes on
the nature of program activities. So that measures corresponding to the
video and ESM data can be matched, videos include a signal from the
video-recorder identifying the ESM signal to which youth responded at
that point in the video.

In a reflection of the dynamic conceptualization of engagement, this
study uses data collected from ESM. As such, learners are prompted at
regular intervals to respond to short questions about their perceptions
of their engagement and its influencers. Though time-consuming to carry
out, ESM can be a powerful measure that leverages the benefits of both
observational and self-report measures, allowing for some ecological
validity and the use of closed-form questionnaires amenable to
quantitative analysis (Csikszentmihalyi \& Larson, 1987). Despite the
logistic challenge of carrying out ESM in large studies, some scholars
have referred to it as the ``gold standard'' for understanding
individual's subjective experience (Schwarz, Kahneman, \& Xu, 2009).
This approach has the benefit of measuring learners' engagement at a
fine grain-size: Changes in the activity on learners' engagement, even
within the same session of the program, and changes in how influencers
of engagement impact engagement and how the activity may relate to
engagement, can be measured.

\section{Data Sources and Measures}\label{data-sources-and-measures}

Data sources consist of self-reported ESM measures of engagement and
learners' perceptions of themselves and the activity, pre-survey
measures of youths' interest, youths' demographic information, and
video-recordings of programs.

\subsection{ESM measures of learners' engagement and its conditions for
the
profiles}\label{esm-measures-of-learners-engagement-and-its-conditions-for-the-profiles}

Measures for engagement and its conditions were constructed from three
ESM responses for engagement and two ESM responses for the conditions of
engagement. The three variables for engagement are for learning (for the
cognitive engagement construct), working hard (for behavioral
engagement), and enjoying (for affective engagement). The variables for
the conditions are for perceived challenge and perceived competence. All
five items are used to construct profiles. Each of the ESM items
consisted of the item text and the following four item response options,
of which youth were directed to select one: Not at all (associated with
the number 1 on the survey), A little (2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much
(4), as presented in Table 3.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-4}ESM measures for profiles of engagement and its conditions}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
\toprule
Construct & Item.text\\
\midrule
Cognitive engagement & As you were signaled, were you learning anything or getting better at something?\\
Behavioral engagement & As you were signaled, how hard were you working?\\
Affective engagement & As you were signaled, did you enjoy what you are doing?\\
Perceived challenge & As you were signaled, how challenging was the main activity?\\
Perceived competence & As you were signaled, were you good at the main activity?\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

\subsection{Survey measures of
pre-interest}\label{survey-measures-of-pre-interest}

Measures of youths' pre-interest are used as youth-level influencers of
the profiles. In particular, three items adapted from Vandell, Hall,
O'Cadiz, and Karsh (2012) were used, with directions for youth to rate
their agreement with the items' text using the same scale as the ESM
items: Not at all (associated with the number 1 on the survey), A little
(2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much (4). The measure was constructed by
taking the maximum value for the scales for the different content areas
(science, mathematics, and engineering), so that the value for a youth
whose response for the science scale was 2.5 and for the mathematics
scale was 2.75 would be 2.5. The items are presented in Table 4.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-5}Measure for pre-program interest in STEM}

\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}

Individual interest in STEM & I am interested in science / mathematics / engineering.\\
 & At school, science / mathematics / engineering is fun\\
 & I have always been fascinated by science / mathematics / engineering)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Codes from video-recordings for work with
data}\label{codes-from-video-recordings-for-work-with-data}

Different aspects of work with data are identified from video-recordings
with the use of a coding frame with five for each of the aspects of work
with data. These codes are developed from the STEM-Program Quality
Assessment (STEM-PQA; Forum for Youth Investment, 2012), an assessment
of quality programming in after school programs. For the PQA, raters
contracted by American Institute of Research (AIR) were trained in the
use of the PQA measure during February, 2017. Raters completed a
four-hour online training module on the overall PQA tool and then
attended an in-person two-day training led by a trainer from the David
P. Weikart Center for Youth Program Quality, the tool's publisher, where
they learned about the instrument, trained on its use, and then
established inter-rater reliability with a master coder. For the
STEM-PQA, three of the same raters contracted by AIR to overall PQA
measure used the STEM-PQA scored one video segment, for which there were
no disagreements on scoring across the four raters on any items. If any
of the raters encountered into a situation that was difficult to score,
they would all discuss the issue by telephone or more often by email
after viewing the video in question and reach a consensus on how to
score the specific item. Programs were divided up among all of the
raters, so raters coded some of the videos for all of the programs.

Specific details on how the measure aligns with the original STEM-PQA on
which this measure is based are presented in the appendix.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-6}Coding Frame for Work With Data}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
\toprule
Code & Description\\
\midrule
Asking questions or defining problems & Discussing and exploring topics to investigate and pose questions.\\
Making observations & Watching and noticing what is happening with respect to the phenomena or problem being investigated.\\
Generating data & Figuring out how or why to inscribe an observation as data and generating coding frames or measurement tools.\\
 & \\
Data modeling & Understanding and explaining phenomena using models of the data that account for variability or uncertainty.\\
Interpreting and communicating findings & Discussing and sharing and presenting findings.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

\subsection{Demographic variables
used}\label{demographic-variables-used}

In addition to the measures described in this section, demographic
information for youths' gender and their racial and ethnic group are
used to construct demographic variables for gender and membership in an
under-represented (in STEM) group; membership in an under-represented
group are identified on the basis of youths' racial and ethnic group
being Hispanic, African American, Asian or Pacific Islanders, or native
American.

\section{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}

The steps for both preliminary and the primary analyses are described in
this section.

\subsection{Preliminary analyses}\label{preliminary-analyses}

First-order Pearson correlations and the frequency, range, mean, and
standard deviations are first examined for all variables. In addition,
the frequency of the codes for aspects of work with data, and the
numbers of responses by youth, program, and moment are examined.

\subsection{Analysis for Research Question \#1 (on the frequency and
nature of work with
data)}\label{analysis-for-research-question-1-on-the-frequency-and-nature-of-work-with-data}

First, the frequency of the codes for the individual aspects of work
with data from the PQA measure of work with data (described above), and
the composite for work with data, which was simply the sum of the codes
for the individual aspects of work with data, are calculated. Then, to
present a qualitative description, all of the segments were coded,
moments associated with specific codes were identified and used to
provide examples for each of the aspects of work with data.

To code the data, three research assistants were trained for
approximately eight hours over four meetings. Then, each research
assistant coded all of the segments associated with one of the videos.
The guiding questions for the qualitative coding were as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are youth doing?
\item
  When asking questions or defining problems is coded, what, if any are
  the questions or problems? Who is asking the question (i.e teacher or
  student)
\item
  When making observations is coded, what are youth doing?
\item
  When generating data is coded, how, if they are, are youth collecting
  or recording data?
\item
  When analyzing or modeling data is coded, what analysis are they
  doing, or what models are they using? Are they talking about
  variability or uncertainty? If so, how?
\item
  When interpreting and communicating findings is coded, what are youth
  interpreting or how are they communicating?
\item
  Is there a phenomena being studied or a problem being investigated? If
  so, what is the phenomena being studied or problem being investigated?
\item
  Is the activity related to something youth have previously done or
  learned about? If so, how?
\item
  Is the activity related to something youth will do or will learn
  about? If so, how?
\item
  Is the activity collaborative? If so, what is happening?
\item
  Is anything else of interest or that is noteworthy going on?
\end{itemize}

After the coding was complete, the three research assistants and I met
to discuss how well the coding frame and potential sources of
disagreement. Then, two coders coded every segment that was coded for at
least one of the aspects of work with data. This coding took around 75
hours of coding by the research assistants. After coding all of the
segments associated with each program, the coders met to discuss
potential issues that emerged throughout the coding, and to clarify how
they applied the coding frame.

I then read through all of the codes for all of the segments, and made
notes associated with each of the five aspects of work with data (i.e.,
asking questions, making observations, and the other aspects). These
notes focused on whether and in what ways there appeared to be alignment
between the codes for work with data (from the PQA) and the conceptual
framework for work with data. I used these notes to write detailed
descriptions of each of the aspects of work with data. I also calculated
how many time these aligned (i.e., how many times both the PQA code for
an aspect of work with data was supported by the qualitative code) for
each aspect of work with data.

\subsection{Analysis for Research Question \#2 (what profiles of
engagement
emerge)}\label{analysis-for-research-question-2-what-profiles-of-engagement-emerge}

\subsubsection{Background information on Latent Profile Analysis
(LPA)}\label{background-information-on-latent-profile-analysis-lpa}

LPA can be used to identify common patterns in learners' ESM responses
as part of a person-oriented analysis to construct the profiles. These
profiles make it possible to analyze the multivariate data collected on
engagement in a way that balances the parsimony of a single model for
all learners with a recognition of individual differences in how
learners' experience each of the dimensions of engagement together at
the same time. A key benefit of the use of LPA, in addition to
likelihood estimation-based fit indices, is probabilities of an
observation being a member of a cluster (unlike in cluster analysis).
LPA also provides \emph{probabilities} of an observation being in a
particular profile, unlike cluster analysis, which involves exclusively
classifying an observation into one profile.

This question addresses what profiles emerged from the ESM responses for
cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and perceptions of
challenge and competence. To answer this question, profiles are
constructed with the five self-reported ESM measures for cognitive,
behavioral, and affective engagement and perceptions of challenge and
competence. Once this step is carried out, the probability of a response
being associated with a profile of engagement and its conditions are
used as the dependent variable for subsequent analyses. Answers to this
question will help to understand how the aspects of engagement relate to
both one another and to key conditions that influence engagement.

To create the profiles, a mixture modeling approach is carried out.
Mixture modeling is an approach for identifying distinct distributions,
or mixtures of distributions, of measured variables. A type of mixture
modeling within a latent variable modeling framework, Latent Profile
Analysis (LPA; Harring \& Hodis, 2016; Muthen, 2004) is used in this
study. LPA allows for capturing the multidimensional nature of
engagement and its conditions, as is the goal of the analysis for the
present study.

\subsubsection{Selecting a model on the basis of fit indices and other
techniques}\label{selecting-a-model-on-the-basis-of-fit-indices-and-other-techniques}

As part of LPA, different models that determine whether and how
different parameters (i.e., means, variances, and covariances) are
estimated. In addition, the number of profiles to estimate must be
provided by the analyst. Determining the number of profiles depends on
fit statistics (such as information criteria and the entropy statistic)
as well as concerns of parsimony and interpretability. In general, the
approach to choosing the model is similar to choosing the number of
profiles, requiring deciding on the basis of evidence from multiple
sources. The models are described in-depth in the appendix. The number
of profiles are determined on the basis of the log-likelihood and
bootstrapped likelihood ratio test, entropy, Akaike Information
Criteria, and Bayesian Information Criteria statistics, as well as
concerns of parsimony and interpretability.

First, I examined a wide range of model types (i.e., the
parameterization of the model, with the six options described in the
appendix as candidates) and the numbers of profiles. These roughly
became more complex, with additional parameters estimated, as the number
for the model type increases from one to six. This step is taken to
select candidate solutions to investigate in more detail. In order to
carry out this analysis, I followed guidelines recommended by the
developers of the MPlus software (Asparouhov \& Muthen, 2012; Muthen \&
Muthen, 2017) as well as those making recommendations about its use
(Geiser, 2012).

To select a model for use in subsequent analyses, the log-likelihood
(LL), a range of information criteria (AIC, BIC, sample adjusted BIC
{[}SABIC{]}, consistent AIC {[}CAIC{]}), statistics about the quality of
the profile assignments (entropy, which represents the mean posterior
probability), statistical tests (Vu-Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT {[}VLMR{]},
Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT {[}LMR{]}, and the bootstrapped LRT {[}BLRT{]}),
and concerns of interpretability and parsimony are used. Past research
suggests that BIC, CAIC, SABIC, and BLRT are most helpful for selecting
the correct number of profiles (Nylund, Asparouhov, \& Muthen, 2007).
For the entropy statistic, higher values are considered better, though
scholars have suggested that the entropy statistic not be used for model
selection (Lubke \& Muthen, 2007). Of the three statistical tests, the
bootstrapped is considered to be the best indicator of which of two
models, one nested (with certain parameters fixed to 0) within the
other, fits better, but it is also the most computationally-intensive to
carry out (Asparouhov \& Muthen, 2012).

\subsection{Statistical software
developed}\label{statistical-software-developed}

The MPlus software is used to carry out LPA as part of this study. In
order to more flexibly carry out LPA, an open-source tool, tidyLPA
(Rosenberg, Schmidt, \& Beymer, ), was developed. This tool provides
interfaces to both the MPlus software and to the open-source mclust
software. In addition to being used as part of this study, this package
is provided free of use to other analysts as the first tool dedicated to
carrying out LPA as part of the R software. More details on the
statistical software developed and included in the Appendix.

\subsection{Analysis for Research Question \#3 (how work with data
relates to
engagement)}\label{analysis-for-research-question-3-how-work-with-data-relates-to-engagement}

Broadly, this question is focused on how work with data, as coded from
video-recordings of the programs, relates to the profiles. For the
primary results for this question, linear models that account for the
cross-classification of the moment and youth are used and for the
``nesting'' of both within each of the nine programs are used. For the
outcome (\emph{y} variable), the probability of a response belonging to
the profile is used; thus, there are six models, for each of the six
profiles, for each specification of the predictor (\emph{x}) variables.

To answer this question, on how well the aspects of work with data
predict the profiles, first, indicators for activities coded for any of
the five aspects of work with data and either of the other two
activities are used to predict each PEC. The \emph{lme4} R package
(Bates, Martin, Bolker, \& Walker, 2015) is used. All of the models for
this and research question \#4 use random effects for learner,
momentary, and program effects. Learner and moment can be considered to
be crossed with both nested within the program. Because the outcome from
LPA is not a hard classification (i.e., an observation is in a
profile---or not) but a probability, the outcome is treated as a
continuous variable. First, null models with only the random parts
(i.e., random learner, momentary, and program effects) are specified.
Then, the predictors are added to the model with the main effects of the
variables added. Lastly, a model with the work with data composite
(constructed as a sum of the values of the variables for the aspects of
work with data) is specified.

\subsection{Analysis for Research Question \#4 (how youth
characteristics relate to
engagement)}\label{analysis-for-research-question-4-how-youth-characteristics-relate-to-engagement}

Research question \#4 is focused on how the relationships of work with
data differ on the basis of pre-program interest and other youth
characteristics--their gender and URM status. Like for the previous two
research questions, models that account for the cross-classification of
the moment and the youth are used. Findings from models with pre
interest, gender, and URM status are first carried out. Then, models
with these variable and the individual aspects and composite of work
with data are added and then models with the interaction between these
characteristics and the composite.

\section{Sensitivity Analysis}\label{sensitivity-analysis}

For observational studies, such as the present study, it can be
important to determine how robust an inference is to alternative
explanations. One approach to addressing this is sensitivity analysis,
which involves quantifying the amount of bias that would be needed to
invalidate an inference (hypothetically, this bias might be due to
omitted or confounding variables, measurement, missing data, etc.).
Using the approach described in Frank, Maroulis, Duong, and Kelcey
(2013), I carried out sensitivity analysis for inferences we made
relative to our key findings. I used the R package konfound (Rosenberg,
Xu, \& Frank, 2018). The result, and what is used to interpret and
contextualize findings, is a numeric value for each effect that
indicates the proportion of the estimate that would have to be biased in
order to invalidate the inference: higher values indicate more robust
estimates in that the inferences would still hold even if there were
substantial bias in the estimate.

\chapter{Results}\label{results}

In this section, I present the results associated with the preliminary
analysis and the four research questions.

\section{Results from the preliminary
analysis}\label{results-from-the-preliminary-analysis}

\subsection{Descriptive statistics for study
variables}\label{descriptive-statistics-for-study-variables}

First, descriptive statistics for all of the study variables--overall
pre-interest, the five variables that are used to estimate the profiles,
are presented. Overall pre-interest and the variables used to estimate
the profiles are presented first.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Correlations among study
variables}\label{correlations-among-study-variables}

Next, correlations between individual aspects of work with data (and the
composite) and the variables that are used to create the profiles are
presented. These correlations suggest that the aspects of work with data
are not related to the aspects of work with data to a large degree,
which is not surprising given the small ICC values for the momentary
level, as the aspects of work with data are associated with this level.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}
\end{landscape}

Most noteworthy is the very small correlations between the aspects of
work with data and the profiles; these correlations range (in absolute
values) from .00 to .05. Only the relations between communicating and
profile six are statistically significant. The composite variable was
correlated with the profiles from (in absolute values) 0.002 to 0.035,
none statistically significant. The aspects of work with data are
modestly correlated with one another, with correlations ranging from .16
to .46; all were significant.

\section{Results for Research Question
\#1}\label{results-for-research-question-1}

\subsection{Frequency of work with
data}\label{frequency-of-work-with-data}

From the coding with the STEM-PQA, work with data appears common. Out of
the 248 segments, 236 were coded for work with data; for the other,
not-coded segments, issues with the video-recordings were the primary
source of the missing data; in these cases, youth may have still replied
to signals, but it was not possible to code for work with data
associated with these responses.

The composite measure, created on the basis of summing the codes for the
five aspects of work with data, has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum
of 5. Its mean is 1.86 (\emph{SD} = 1.61). This indicates that, on
average, youth were engaged in 1.86 aspects of the work with data during
the program.

We can also examine the breakdown by program, which shows that,
descriptively, there exists substantial variability.

\subsection{Nature of work with data}\label{nature-of-work-with-data}

Each of the segments of video was coded. This coding resulted in
approximately three to four sentence notes from each of two raters for
every segment. I then reviewed these notes with the aim to identify
themes based on enriching and better understanding the aspects of work
with data.

\subsubsection{Asking questions or identifying
problems}\label{asking-questions-or-identifying-problems}

Asking questions occurred in 92 of the segments (as coded by the PQA).
In the 92 segments that were coded with asking questions, the
open-ended, in-depth analysis identified 36 segments that were focused
on asking questions in ways that clearly aligned with the conceptual
framework for work with data. Qualitative coding showed that this aspect
of work with data was highly variable. When the qualitative coding
revealed this code to be present, it was often when youth were trying to
better understand the phenomenon or problem they were investigating. For
example, in a segment during the \emph{Ecosphere} program in which youth
constructed inclined tables to study how water moved throughout the
ecosystem, the youth activity leader prompted youth to generate
hypotheses of what would happen when water was poured onto the table,
before pouring the water. Other segments showed that there were also
many segments for which the PQA codes suggested asking questions would
be present, but the in-depth analysis revealed were not always always
focused on predicting, conjecturing, or hypothesizing. In these cases,
the code was applied to instances in which the youth were asking generic
questions (i.e., about how they do an assignment) or when the instructor
was asking youth questions (i.e., math-related questions). For example,
in the \emph{Marine Investigators} program, youth visited a water
treatment site, and were provided opportunities to ask questions about
what they saw.

\subsubsection{Making observations}\label{making-observations}

Making observations occurred in 57 of the segments (as coded by the
PQA), 49 which the open-ended coding revealed were clearly aligned with
the coding frame, indicating that this code was used in ways that were
close to how this aspect of work with data was conceptualized. Many of
the times, this code was applied in conjunction with observing
phenomenon in the field, or, in the case of engineering-focused
programs, noticing what was going on with a particular design. For
example, in the \emph{Building Mania} program, youth constructed Rube
Goldberg machines; youth were prompted by the activity leaders to notice
how changes in their design led to differences in how far objects were
launched or rolled. When qualitative coders determined this was not
present, it was usually due to the observations being not of phenomena,
but of the instructor. For example, in the \emph{Adventures in
Mathematics} program, instances in which youth observed other youth or
the youth activity leader solving a mathematics problem was often coded
as involving making observations.

\subsubsection{Generating data}\label{generating-data}

Generating data occurred in 102 segments (as coded by the PQA), 48 of
which the in-depth analysis showed were aligned with the coding frame.
When present based on qualitative codes, youth were writing down
observations, recording information from experiments, or recording the
results of a trial (in engineering contexts). For example, in the
\emph{Marine Investigators} program, youth collected pieces of
recyclable plastic, bringing them back to the classroom and counting
them for each location they were collected. When the PQA code indicated
that work with data was present, but the subsequent analysis indicated
that this practice was not evident, this was often youth were writing
down what the youth activity leader was saying, or was focused on
collecting specimens, but not writing them down, entering them into a
spreadsheet, or otherwise recording them as data. For example, again in
the \emph{Marine Investigators} program, youth used nets to collect
saltwater organisms, which they then transported in buckets back to the
classroom setting for subsequent analysis. While these specimens could
be considered as data, at least in the segment described, youth did not
inscribe notes or any other observations on the specimens they were
collecting, and so data was not generated (at this stage).

\subsubsection{Data modeling}\label{data-modeling}

Data modeling occurred in 68 segments (as coded by the PQA), 49 which
were aligned with the coding frame. Like making observations, for data
modeling, there was a high degree of alignment between the PQA codes and
what the open-ended coding. When this aspect of work with data was found
to be present on the basis of the qualitative coding, youth used
mathematical models. For example, in the \emph{Comunidad de Aprendizaje}
program, youth accessed nationally-representative data and were tasked
to solve problems, like finding out what percentage of people engage in
particular activities, like donating to charity. When the PQA code was
present but data modeling was not done in a way aligned with the
conceptual framework for work with data, the youth activity leader,
rather than students, was doing the modeling, or the model was not one
that could generate data. For example, in the \emph{Marine
Investigators} program, a youth activity leader used a plush toy seal
designed to teach youth about anatomy and the dangers of aquatic mammals
consuming trash and recyclables.

\subsubsection{Interpreting and communicating
findings}\label{interpreting-and-communicating-findings}

Codes for interpreting and communicating were present in 103 segments
(as coded by the PQA), in-depth, open-ended coding revealed 49 were
aligned with the coding frame. When the qualitative coding revealed this
aspect of work with data to be present, youth were often sharing what
they found from an investigation or the results of using the product
they designed. For example, in the \emph{Comunidad de Aprendizaje}
program, youth participated in an activity designed to support their
thinking about creating a product to bring to market; the youth activity
leaders described this as being akin to the television show the
\emph{Shark Tank}. In one segment, the youth activity leader asks youth
to think of an idea that would make an investor willing to invest in;
students shared their ideas, describing what their ideas was, why it was
a good idea, how much they could sell it for, and what their profit
would be, while fielding questions from youth activity leaders and their
peers. Interpreting and communicating findings was also commonly present
in segments in which youth were debating the findings of an
investigation, such as the results of calculations for the amount of
recyclables entering waterways (in \emph{Marine Investigators}). When
not present, which was common, youth were communicating about topics
other than the results of an investigation or design process, such as
trying to find out the answer to a question posed by the youth activity
leader, or the youth activity leader was who was doing the interpreting
and communicating. For example, in the \emph{Adventures in Mathematics}
program, the youth activity leader helped youth to solve problems on a
worksheet, asking guiding questions to help youth start to solve
problems on their own.

\subsection{Summary of Findings for Research Question
\#1}\label{summary-of-findings-for-research-question-1}

This suggests that differences in how work with data was conceptualized
and operationalized may lead, in some cases, to codes that do not
reflect work with data accurately, and can lead to some findings that
seem unexpected given what we know about the potential for work with
data to be engaging to youth.

\section{Results for Research Question \#2: What profiles of youth
engagement and its conditions emerge from experiential data collected in
the
programs?}\label{results-for-research-question-2-what-profiles-of-youth-engagement-and-its-conditions-emerge-from-experiential-data-collected-in-the-programs}

For every combination of models one through six and from two through ten
profiles, only solutions associated with model specifications 1 and 2
(and among these two solutions, only those associated with particular
number of profiles) converged. This suggests that the more complex
models were too complex given the systematic variability in the data
used for the analysis. Thus, only solutions associated with models 1
(the model with varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to
zero) and model 2 (varying means, equal variances, and equal
covariances) were explored in subsequent sections.

Following from the in-depth exploration of all of the models that
converged (as described in the Appendix), the model one type, six
profile model is selected on the basis of a range of criteria including
fit statistics, statistical tests, and concerns of interpretability and
parsimony. This model demonstrated superior fit on the basis of the
information criteria (AIC and BIC) and on the basis of the measure of
classification accuracy (entropy) and it was also highly interpretable.
The model one type, seven profile solution also demonstrated good fit
and high interpretability; this model is presented in detail in the
Appendix. For the selected model, presented below, the raw data and the
data that are centered to have a mean equal to 0 and a standard
deviation of 1 (thus, the y-axis on each of the plots is labeled
``Z-score'').

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{rosenberg-dissertation_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1} \end{center}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{rosenberg-dissertation_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-2} \end{center}

This solution is characterized by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \emph{full} profile, profile 6
\item
  An \emph{universally low} profile, profile 2
\item
  An \emph{all moderate} profile, profile 5--and, like, the model 1, six
  profile solution--with moderate levels of affective engagement
\item
  An \emph{only behaviorally engaged} profile, profile 1, with moderate
  levels of behavioral engagement, very low affective engagement, and
  moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and
  competence
\item
  An \emph{only affectively engaged} profile, profile 4, with moderate
  levels of affective engagement, low levels of behavioral engagement,
  and moderately (low) levels of cognitive engagement and challenge and
  competence
\item
  An \emph{engaged and competent but not challenged} profile, profile 3,
  characterized by high levels of each of the three dimensions of
  engagement and of competence, but with low levels of challenge
\end{itemize}

The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is
somewhat balanced, with the universally low profile with the largest
number of observations (\emph{n} = 667), followed by the all moderate
profile (\emph{n} = 638). Each of the other four profiles were
associated with 300 to 400 observations. Unlike other solutions, this
solution was associated with profiles that distinguished observations on
the basis of both: There were profiles for only behaviorally and
affectively engaged and for engaged and competent but not challenged.

\subsection{Summary of research question \#2
findings}\label{summary-of-research-question-2-findings}

After reviewing a wide range of models, a relatively simple model (model
1) with six profiles was selected for use in subsequent analyses. This
model has momentary profiles of engagement and its conditions
characterized by both varying levels on the dimensions of engagement and
perceptions of challenge and competence. In addition, the number of
observations across the profiles is relatively balanced.

\section{Results for Research Question \#3: How do data practices relate
to youth engagement in the
programs?}\label{results-for-research-question-3-how-do-data-practices-relate-to-youth-engagement-in-the-programs}

\subsection{Null models}\label{null-models}

The null models presented in the table provide insight into the levels
at which predictors may be able to explain the outcome. For all six
profiles, the ICCs at the program level were very small, from 0.00 to
0.023. This suggests that very little variability can be explained
simply by the program. For the momentary level, the ICCs were also very
small, ranging from 0.004 to 0.011. Finally, the youth-level ICCs ranged
from .099 to .427.

Looking across these values, considering variability at the program,
momentary, and youth levels, most of the explained variability in the
responses is associated with youth; the program and momentary levels
were associated with very small values, suggesting that variables at
these levels have minimal variability to explain. In turn, this suggests
that these variables, including those for work with data, may not have
strong effects in terms of their relations with the profiles.

In terms of specific ICCs at the youth level, the value for the
youth-level ICC was highest for the \emph{full} profile, suggesting that
some youth have a strong tendency to be fully engaged (possibly due to
their initial interest or other individual characteristics and
differences). The other profile characterized by a consistent pattern
across all of the variables--the \emph{universally low} profile--had a
modest ICC, .265. Finally, a large amount of variability is associated
with the residual (variance that is not associated with the program,
momentary, or youth levels). This suggests that there is wide variation
in students' responses that may not be readily explained or predicted.

\subsection{Models with variables for aspects of work with data added
separately}\label{models-with-variables-for-aspects-of-work-with-data-added-separately}

When the predictor variables for work with data are added, some overall
patterns and specific findings can be identified. The only relations
with \emph{p}-values that were below the criterion for statistical
significance (.05) were for the relations between modeling data and the
\emph{full} profile (\(\beta\) = 0.036 (0.016), \emph{p} = .016) and
between generating data and the full profile (\(\beta\) = 0.029 (0.015),
\emph{p} = .024). Interpreting and communicating findings was positively
related to the \emph{Only behavioral} profile (\(\beta\) = 0.025
(0.014), \emph{p} = .043).

\begin{landscape}\begin{table}

\end{tabular}}
\end{table}
\end{landscape}

Adding these variables changed the (conditional upon the random effects)
R\textsuperscript{2} values from, .002 to .018, very small changes
suggesting that the aspects of work with data do not strongly predict
the profiles. This is in-line with the correlations for these variables
with those variables that make up the profiles, and the ICC values at
the momentary level.

The sensitivity analysis for the effect of generating data suggested
that 1.884\% of the inference would have to be due to bias to invalidate
the inference, suggesting that this effect is not very robust to
potential sources of bias, such as an omitted (in this analysis)
confounding (or control) variable. For the effect of modeling, 9.835\%
would need to be due to bias to invalidate the inference and for the
effect of interpreting and communicating findings, 9.41\% would need to
be due to bias.

\subsection{Models with the composite
added}\label{models-with-the-composite-added}

For the composite of work with data, the composite predicted the profile
for \emph{only behavioral} (\(\beta\) = 0.007 (0.004), \emph{p} = .021),
but not any of the other profiles. However, this coefficient is very
small in practical terms. 12.261\% would need to be due to bias to
invalidate the inference. The change in R\textsuperscript{2} values
ranged from .003 to .020, suggesting minimal potential relations among
factors (such as support for work with data as measured by the composite
variable) at the momentary level. When the composite was treated as a
dichotomous (instead of a continuous) variable, so that the variable
takes a value of one if any of the aspects of work with data are
present, the results are similar in terms of the magnitude of the
effects and their significance, as none of the relations are
statistically significant when the dichotomous variable is used.

\end{table}

\subsection{Summary of findings for research question
\#3}\label{summary-of-findings-for-research-question-3}

When looking across findings, we find few relations between work with
data and the profiles, though there were notable effects of modeling and
generating data, though they were small effects (i.e., when students are
doing this, they are around 3\% more likely to be responding in a way
associated with the \emph{full} profile).

\begin{landscape}\begin{table}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}
\end{landscape}

The composite for work with data had a relation of around 0.01 with the
\emph{only behavioral} profile, suggesting that for each one-value
increase in the composite (which has a range from one to five), this
profile is around 1\% more likely. These findings are similar to those
obtained when the model 1 type, seven profile solution is used for the
outcome variables; see the appendix for more detail. Broadly, further
explanations and investigations of these effects --focusing on the
characteristics of work with data in the context of summer STEM programs
and how this support is measured in terms of codes from the video--are
the focus on research question \#4 and are discussed in the next
chapter. Moreover, these findings are deepened in subsequent analyses
for research questions \#4.

\section{Results for Research Question \#4: How do youth characteristics
relate to their engagement in summer STEM
programs?}\label{results-for-research-question-4-how-do-youth-characteristics-relate-to-their-engagement-in-summer-stem-programs}

In this section, models with the individual characteristics added
separately followed by models with their interactions with the work with
data composite are specified.

\subsection{Models with pre interest, gender, and under-represented
minority (URM)
status}\label{models-with-pre-interest-gender-and-under-represented-minority-urm-status}

These results show that overall pre-interest is associated with the
\emph{engaged and competent but not challenged} profile (\(\beta\) =
0.039 (0.021), p = .009). The effect of being a female has a relation of
0.059 (0.036, p = .054) upon the probability of a response being
associated with the \emph{universally low} profile; though this effect
did not meet the criteria for statistical significance, sensitivity
analysis to determine how much more robust the effect would need to be
to make an inference. For the effect of overall pre-interest upon the
\emph{engaged and competent but not challenged} profile, 17.879\% would
be needed to invalidate the inference, suggesting a moderately robust
effect. For the effect of gender upon the \emph{universally low}
profile, 16.996\% of the bias would need to be removed (or the effect
would need to be larger by this percentage) to sustain the inference.
The change in R\textsuperscript{2} values ranged from .004 to .007,
suggesting that pre-interest and other individual characteristics - in
addition to the aspects of work with data - have minimal relations with
the profiles. This is more surprising than the similarly minimal
relations observed for work with data: as the null models indicate,
there were large ICCs (a large proportion of the variability in the
outcome variables) at the youth-level (as pre-interest, gender, and URM
status are variables associated with this level). This is discussed
further in the next chapter.

\subsection{Pre-interest, gender, and URM status interactions work with
data
composite}\label{pre-interest-gender-and-urm-status-interactions-work-with-data-composite}

These results show similar patterns to the earlier models.Like in the
models with only pre-interest and the other individual characteristics
alone (and like in the model with the individual aspects), pre-interest
is related to the \emph{only behavioral} profile (\(\beta\) = 0.033
(0.018), p = .033). Being female is again related but not to a level
that it meets the criteria for statistical significance (\(\beta\) =
0.064 (0.041), p = .059). With the interactions added, the composite was
no significantly related to the \emph{only behavioral} profile
(\(\beta\) = 0.016 (0.016), p = .156) to a similar extent and with
similar robustness as found in the separate model. One interaction,
between pre-interest and being female, had a significant effect upon the
profile for \emph{full} engagement (\(\beta\) = 0.012 (0.006), p =
.026). However, only 1.953\% of the effect would need to be due to bias
to invalidate the inference. The R\textsuperscript{2} values, relative
to the models with only random effects (the null models), increased from
.003 to .028, again suggesting small effects of the predictors upon the
profiles. Note that ``Comp.'' refers to the data modeling composite.

\subsection{Summary of findings for research question
\#4}\label{summary-of-findings-for-research-question-4}

When looking across findings, we find minimal relations between
pre-interest and other individual characteristics.

In particular, we found that pre-interest was related to the
\emph{engaged and comptent but not challenged} profile to a modest
extent. Being female did not demonstrate statistically significant
relations with the \emph{univerally low} profile, though some
moderately-sized effects that were nearly statistically significant were
observed and interpreted in terms of how much bias would need to be
reduced (or how much the larger the effect would need to be) in order
for this relation to be statistically significant.Note that the positive
pre-interest coefficient is the estimate from the model with the
interaction (without the interaction, the coefficient was also
statistically significant and was 0.039). These results, like those for
research question \#2, are similar to those obtained when the model 1
type, seven profile solution is used for the outcome variables. There
were few interactive effects observed; the magnitude of the effect of
the composite and gender interaction was small (as were the changes in
the R\textsuperscript{2} value as a consequence of adding this
interaction), and the effect appears to not be highly robust to
potential sources of bias. Like for research question \#2, reasons for
why this may be are explored in the next chapter.

\chapter{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\section{Key Findings}\label{key-findings}

\subsection{Key findings for research question \#1 (on the frequency and
nature of work with
data)}\label{key-findings-for-research-question-1-on-the-frequency-and-nature-of-work-with-data}

In terms of the frequency and nature of work with data, work with data
was found to be common in the summer STEM programs that made the context
for this study, with frequencies ranging from .258 (making observations)
to .470 (communicating findings) of the programs, with any aspect being
present in {[}add{]} of the program. Data modeling was, like making
observations, less common, whereas asking questions and generating data,
like communicating findings, were relatively more common. This suggests
that work with data is, in general, common across STEM programs, as
expected based on past research (Lee \& Wilkerson, in press) and the
design and goals of such programs (Dabney et al., 2012; Elam et al.,
2012; add). Subsequent qualitative showed that asking questions,
generating data, and interpreting and communicating findings, the three
aspects that were \emph{more frequent} in the programs, also were the
most inconsistent with how work with data was conceptualized in this
study. This suggests that while work with data is somewhat common, more
veridical forms of it are somewhat less common, occurring in around 25\%
of the programs' time. While descriptive in nature, these results
present the first insight that I am aware of of the extent of work with
data in STEM enrichment programs. They suggest that, as past scholarship
(National Research Council, 2009, 2012) can provide a context for youth
to be involved in the type of scientific and engineering
practices-focused activities that can be particularly powerful for youth
(and students) in terms of their learning.

\subsection{Key findings for research question \#2 (what profiles of
engagement
emerge)}\label{key-findings-for-research-question-2-what-profiles-of-engagement-emerge}

Six profiles of engagement and its conditions were identified. These
profiles included those that were strongly negative (\emph{Universally
low}) and strongly positive (\emph{Full}), as well as those
characterized by different levels of engagement (\emph{Only behavioral}
and \emph{Only affective}) and by different levels of the conditions of
engagement (Engaged and Competent but not Challenged). An \emph{All
moderate} profile was also identified. The profiles suggest that the
experiences of youth in summer STEM programs are variable and that the
use of ESM can aid in the study of youths' engagement. Little research
has examined profiles of engagement, though Schmidt et al. (2018)
examined profiles of momentary engagement, constructed from items for
cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement (but not perceptions of
challenge and competence), and found six profiles, some of which
partially overlap with those found in the present study. In particular,
on the basis of the items shared between the studies, a
\emph{Universally low}, \emph{All moderate}, and \emph{Full} profile
were found in both studies. However, as these profiles are characterized
by the (uniform) level across all of the variables, this is only limited
evidence for the presence of these profiles in the larger population of
youth engaged in science and STEM-related learning activities.

\subsection{Key findings for research question \#3 (how work with data
relates to
engagement)}\label{key-findings-for-research-question-3-how-work-with-data-relates-to-engagement}

Before relations between the groups of ``predictor'' variables, work
with data and youth characteristics, and the profiles, were explored,
the amount of variability that could be explained at the program, youth,
and momentary levels were explored. The amount of variability that could
be explained at the program and momentary level was small (no larger for
any profile than .023, and as low as .00 at the program level and .004
at the momentary level for some profiles), while the amount of
variability that could be explained at the youth level was moderate to
large (between .099 and .427). This suggests that while there is
variability in the composition of the profiles that were identified,
youth characteristics--their pre-program thoughts, beliefs, and
characteristics and their inclination to engage in particular ways
throughout the program--largely explains the prevalence of the profiles.
This also suggests that what youth do during the programs, and the
design and implementation of the programs themselves, have little to do
with how youth engage in them. This implies that even the strongest
predictor variables at these (momentary and program) levels would likely
not explain much variability in the profiles (though this is not always
the case, as there are cases in which adding variables at one level can
increase the amount of variability that can be explained at another;
Gelman \& Hill, 2007).

In line with what the preliminary analysis of the amount of variability
that could be explained at the youth, momentary, and program levels,
relations between work with data were largely not found, though some
small, statistically significant relations were identified. Importantly,
both generating and modeling data were found to be positively related to
the \emph{Full} profile, suggesting that when youth are involved in
these practices, then they are more likely to report high levels of
cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and high perceptions of
competence and challenge. The effect of data modeling was more robust
than that for generating data, the latter which should be interpreted
with caution. In short, this suggests that these activities are
beneficial to youths' engagement. Both communicating and interpreting
findings and the composite measure for work with data were positively
related to the \emph{Only behavioral} profile and these findings were
fairly robust. This profile may indicate that students are experiencing
a routine engagement (and not particularly adaptive) when they are
communicating findings and being involved in work with data in general.
As there is no research on how work with data relates to youths'
engagement, the findings associated with this research question provide
some, albeit limited, evidence (and directions for future research) for
how some aspects of work with data relate to youths' engagement.

\subsection{Key findings for research question \#4 (how youth
characteristics relate to
engagement)}\label{key-findings-for-research-question-4-how-youth-characteristics-relate-to-engagement}

Not as much in line with expectations given the preliminary analysis,
relations between youth characteristics and the profiles were found to
be small. In this way, these small relations were similar (in magnitude)
to those between work with data and the profiles. Youth with higher
pre-program interest were more likely to be \emph{Engaged and competent
but not challenged}, suggesting that youth with higher interest in STEM
are inclined to be highly engaged and good at what they are doing, but
are not challenged by the activities they experience. This could be a
function of the relationship between youths' interest and their
competence before the program, which are often strongly related
({[}add{]}); these youth, as a result of their higher interest and
competence, need more challenging activities to be more fully engaged.
This effect was fairly robust. The interaction with gender and the work
with data composite revealed a positive relationship with \emph{Full}
engagement, suggesting that the more that female youth work with data,
the more likely they are to be positively engaged. However, sensitivity
analysis revealed that this effect was not very robust, which, along
with its small magnitude, suggests that it should be interpreted with
some caution. Finding that female youth who are engaged in work with
data are more likely to be fully engaged is important, given that past
research has suggested that female students are less likely to be
engaged in STEM classes but we have limited information about what types
of instruction may best support female students to be engaged and
successful (e.g., Patall et al., 2017).

\section{Limitations of the Study and Recommendations for Future
Research}\label{limitations-of-the-study-and-recommendations-for-future-research}

This study examines youths' engagement as an outcome. Accordingly,
outcomes from engaging, such as the products of neither youths' work or
the specific cognitive capabilities they develop through their
participation, are not the focus. Thus, while some findings about how
work with data and youth characteristics were found to be associated
with different profiles of engagement and its conditions, we do not have
an understanding of how engaging in more or less adaptive ways relates
to these outcomes. Examining how work with data and engagement relate to
key learning, motivational, and future goals and plans-related outcomes
is a topic for future research.

Another limitation concerns the context of the study, summer STEM
programs. While the programs that were involved in the study have many
affordances for work with data and for being highly engaging for youth,
they have some limitations, too, particularly with respect to support
work with data. Importantly, these were not programs explicitly designed
to support work with data; while such contexts are being developed, they
are not yet widespread. Learning environments that deliberately support
work with data over a long period may demonstrate different patterns of
engagement than those examined in this study because of the focus on and
sequencing of the aspects of work with data, which may make it more (or
less) cognitively, behaviorally, or affectively engaging than is
determined in this study. As Miller, Manz, Russ, Stroupe, and Berland
(2018) highlight, truly engaging STEM activities are not easily come by;
they require students to take ownership over and to make decisions about
their explorations or designs. Thus, future research may study work with
data in contexts designed to support it. A key part of this future
research may be studying both work with data and how work with data is
supported (most importantly by the instructor but also by the curriculum
and technological tools).

A related limitation is that the programs that were the focus of this
study were model programs, or those based on characteristics of
exemplary STEM enrichment programs. As a result, engagement may be
different in other STEM enrichment programs depending on characteristics
of the programs and their activities, and findings from this study
should be interpreted in terms of programs that share similar
characteristics.

A potential issue concerns the analytic approach. As noted above, the
profiles demonstrated very little variability at the program and
momentary level, suggesting that factors at this level would likely not
strongly predict the profiles. This could be a function of the use of
profiles and the specific variables selected. It may also be the result
of the outcome (engagement and its conditions) selected. Other analytic
approaches can be carried out to determine the viability of the profiles
approach and use of the items for engagement and its conditions for
understanding work with data.

A final limitation concerns the measures used. In particular, the
qualitative coding revealed alignment but also discrepancies between
work with data as determined from the PQA codes and the conceptual
framework for work with data. While these issues were small, they
suggest that the coding frame for work with data is a limitation of the
present study.

While these are important limitations, it is worth noting that the
modeling strategy (with the mixed effects models) in inherently a
conservative approach. Thus, while the findings detected are small, they
can be considered to be trustworthy on the basis of the way the ESM data
were analyzed. This trustworthiness is enhanced by the use of
sensitivity analysis, which showed how much of the effects could be due
to bias for them to be invalidated.

\section{Implications for Practice}\label{implications-for-practice}

\subsection{Engage youth in key aspects of work with
data}\label{engage-youth-in-key-aspects-of-work-with-data}

While limited evidence, this study suggests that generating and modeling
data in particular may be beneficial in terms of engaging youth.
Generating data in particular may be a key practice because it involves
making work with data concrete; as Lehrer and Schauble (2015) describe,
recording data in the form of ``inscriptions'' can serve as commitments
that learners make (in terms of what data were chosen to be collected
and recorded). This implication, in particular, should be interpreted
with caution, however, given the very small magnitude of the effect.
Similarly, data modeling has been described as \emph{the} central
scientific and engineering practice (Schwarz et al., 2009; Lehrer \&
Schauble, 2015; Weisberg, 2012), and its relations with full engagement
provides some actionable evidence for its importance in the context of
summer STEM programs.

Practically, youth activity leaders (in summer STEM and other STEM
enrichment contexts) and teachers (in formal learning environments) can
best include the beneficial practices of generating and modeling data
not in isolation, but rather through involving learners in complete
cycles of investigation. This aligns with both foundational and
contemporary research on work with data in education (Berland et al.,
2018; McNeill \& Berland, 2017; Hancock et al., 1992; Lee \& Wilkerson,
2018). Recent curricular reform efforts also suggest that the best way
to engage learners in particular practices is through the process of
identifying a question or problem, marshaling sources of data that can
be used to figure out what is happening, and developing model-based
explanations that are then communicated (or even used in an argument;
National Governors Association, 2013; National Research Council, 2012;
NGSS Lead States, 2013). With respect to work with data in particular,
youth activity leaders and teachers can use the findings from this study
as a starting point to consider how engaging in work with data may also
prepare learners to think of, understand, and take action based on data
in their day-to-day lives. Many questions or problems learners face may
involve data that can be meaningfully incorporated into engaging
learning activities.

\subsection{Leverage the affordances of summer STEM and other STEM
enrichment
programs}\label{leverage-the-affordances-of-summer-stem-and-other-stem-enrichment-programs}

Another implication for practice concerns the affordances (and
constraints) of summer STEM and other STEM enrichment programs. One
affordance of these programs relevant to these informal and to K-12
learning environments concerns selecting activities that are engaging to
learners. For example, in the \emph{Marine Investigators}, youth
participated in activities designed to help them understand water
quality in their ecosystem. Youth collected trash from sites around
their community (in different ``districts'') and then brought the trash
and recyclable plastic back to the classroom. Then, the youth activity
leaders asked students to figure out how much plastic enters local
waterways. As a part of this activity, youth activity leaders asked
students not only to determine the quantity of trash that entered the
waterways, but asked students about \emph{why} they used math in
particular ways (i.e., adding the quantity of trash collected and then
extrapolating from this quantity to the amount from across the entire
city over the course of the year). This appeared to be a powerful
activity, one that was coded as involving all five aspects of work with
data according to the measures for instructional support for work with
data; this type of activity seemed to suggest that instructional support
for work with data may impact youth's engagement.

Another affordance concerned the relevance of the program to youth's
lives. For example, in the \emph{Building Mania} program, youth are
involved in engineering design (i.e., identifying a problem and
designing a solution), particularly around the use of simple machines.
In a day in the classroom setting, youth are creating, testing, and
revising catapults. In the next day, youth visit an area University, and
are led in a discussion by a physicist who works with particle
colliders. In this example, the expertise of the physicist, who
explicitly mentions the benefits of engaging in the engineering design
process and the importance of combining engineering to addressing
problems (such as mitigating the damage of earthquakes), seems to be
highly relevant to what youth are doing in their class. In these two
days of class, youth are engaged in different aspects of work with data
as indicated by the codes for instructional support for work with data
(collecting data on the efficacy of their designs in the classroom day,
and asking questions in the subsequent day, particularly); these seem to
suggest, like the example of work work with data from the \emph{Marine
Investigators} program, affordances of work with data for summer STEM
programs.

\subsection{Consider the constraints of summer STEM and other STEM
enrichment
programs}\label{consider-the-constraints-of-summer-stem-and-other-stem-enrichment-programs}

There are also constraints to summer STEM and other STEM enrichment
programs. For example, youth activity leaders faced challenges linking
activities as part of a complete cycle of investigation. For example, in
the \emph{Ecosphere} program, youth collected water samples in the
field. They then brought these samples to the classroom and tested the
water, involving students in both collecting and, to a degree,
generating data (by noting the pH levels of the water). However, later
in the day, youth created a small-scale model (with inclined trays of
dirt, rocks, and plants) of an ecosystem, in which they added food
coloring to determine the impacts of chemicals and acid rain. Youth then
interpreted and discussed these findings, but did not connect the
discussion to the water samples youth collected and tested earlier. This
activity presented an opportunity for deeper engagement, in which youth
could interpret and communicate findings related to the state of the
water in their ecosystem, but, instead, it was potentially limiting in
terms of youth's engagement in work with data.

Another constraint related to the challenge of linking activities
concerned what the programs focused on. For example, the
mathematics-focused programs, such as the \emph{Adventures in
Mathematics} program, the youth activity leaders recognizing that youth
had difficulty solving equations, used duct tape and a ``hippity
hoppity'', building on an earlier activity in which youth considered
what constituted a rate, on how many ``hops'' it would take someone to
move from one end of the line of duct tape to the other; the youth
activity leader than asked youth to consider how far they could move in
one hop and to consider how they could find out many hops it would take,
using a mathematical equation. In this activity, youth were supported to
approach mathematics problem-solving in creative ways. However, apart
from data modeling, other aspects of work with data were rarely present,
and most of the data that youth worked with was provided by the teacher
or considered in the abstract. Programs focused on science or
engineering, similarly, emphasized other aspects of work with data: The
science-focused programs (\emph{Island Explorers}, \emph{The Ecosphere},
and \emph{Marine Investigators}) all emphasized collecting and
generating data, but data, particularly the data collected or generated,
was rarely modeled or interpreted. In the engineering-focused programs
(\emph{Uptown Architecture}, \emph{Crazy Machines}, and \emph{Dorchester
House}, youth often collected data that resulted from their engineering
designs, and communicated and interpreted their findings, but, did not
generate data, and, accordingly, (and like the science-focused programs)
did not model data as a regular part of their activities. This finding
suggests that while work with data may have been common overall,
different aspects of instructional support for work with data were
emphasized to different degrees based on the focus of the program.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Each of the disciplines that contribute to STEM learning involve work
with data and how youth and students work with data in engaging ways is
a concern of researchers and practitioners. While past research has
focused on what practices learners do when working with data, or
specific conceptual outcomes, little research has considered youths'
experience of working with data. In this study, engagement was used as a
lens to understand the experience of youth working with data in the
context of nine summer STEM programs. In particular, five aspects of
work with data, a) asking questions, b) observing phenomena, c)
constructing measures and generating data, d) data modeling, and e)
interpreting and communicating findings, were identified from
video-recordings of the programs. These codes were then used to predict
profiles, or distinct groups on the basis of different levels, of
youths' cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, and two other
variables, youths' perceptions of challenge and competence. These
measures were obtained using an innovative method, ESM, that provides
some access to youths' experience in-the-moment of the activities they
were involved in during the program.

Findings indicate that work with data occurs regularly in the programs
and that there are some examples of ambitious activities centered on
working with real-world data (and examples in which the work with data
is not fully aligned with youth-driven work with data). Six profiles of
engagement and its conditions were identified, representing different
configurations of the three dimensions of engagement and its conditions.
Relations of work with data and youth characteristics (pre-program
interest in STEM and youths' gender and status in terms of being a
member of under-represented groups in STEM) were, overall, not strongly
related with the profiles of engagement and its conditions, though some
key findings were identified. Generating and modeling data were both
related to the most potentially beneficial profile, one characterized by
high levels of all five of the variables used to create the profiles.
Female youth who were involved in work with data (at the momentary
level) to a greater extent were also more likely to be fully engaged.
This study suggests that work with data has purchase as an organizing
set of activities for STEM can have some benefits in terms of
understanding the nature of what youth do in summer STEM programs. In
addition, this study shows that ESM and engagement can be used to
understand youths' experiences. Data--and who is able to work with
data--have important roles in STEM learning and in society; efforts to
understand and support learners engaging in these ambitious activities
should be encouraged and expanded.

\subsection{Appendix B: Program
descriptions}\label{appendix-b-program-descriptions}

\subsection{Appendix C: Model specifications
details}\label{appendix-c-model-specifications-details}

Here, the six models that are possible to specify in LPA are described
in terms of how the variables used to create the profiles are estimated.
Note that \emph{p} represents different profiles and each
parameterization is represented by a 4 x 4 covariance matrix and
therefore would represent the parameterization for a four-profile
solution. In all of the models, the means are estimated freely in the
different profiles. Imagine that each row and column represents a
different variable, i.e., the first row (and column) represents broad
interest, the second enjoyment, the third self-efficacy, and the fourth
another variable, i.e., future goals and plans. Models 1 and 3 meet the
assumption of independence, that is, that, after accounting for their
relations with the profile, the variables used to estimate the profiles
are independent (Collins \& Lanza, 2010). They estimate variable
variances but do not estimate covariances (i.e., as can be seen, the
covariance matrices are ``diagonal,'' without any off-diagonal
parameters that are estimated). These models are estimated by default in
MPlus, although these assumptions can be relaxed (Muthen \& Muthen,
2017). Importantly, this does not mean the variables used to create the
profile are assumed to be not related; as Collins and Lanza (2010)
explain:

\begin{quote}
The local independence assumption refers only to conditioning on the
latent variable. It does not imply that in a data set that is to be
analyzed, the observed variables are independent. In fact, it is the
relations among the observed variables that are explained by the latent
classes. An observed data set is a mixture of all the latent classes.
Independence is assumed to hold only within each latent class, which is
why it is called ``local''.
\end{quote}

Despite the assumption of independence, as Collins and Lanza (2010),
Muthen and Muthen (2017), and others (i.e., Pastor et al., 2007; Vermunt
\& Magidson, 2002) note, it can be lifted to improve model fit, though
these models without the assumption of independence may be better
described as general or Gaussian mixture models (Fraley et al., 2017).

\subsubsection{Varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to
0 (model
1)}\label{varying-means-equal-variances-and-covariances-fixed-to-0-model-1}

In this model, which corresponds to the mclust model wit the name
``EEI'', the variances are estimated to be equal across profiles,
indicated by the absence of a p subscript for any of the diagonal
elements of the matrix. The covariances are constrained to be zero, as
indicated by the 0's between every combination of the variables. Thus,
this model is highly constrained but also parsimonious: the profiles are
estimated in such a way that the variables' variances are identical for
each of the profiles, and the relationships between the variables are
not estimated. In this way, less degrees of freedom are taken used to
explain the observations that make up the data. However, estimating more
parameters--as in the other models--may better explain the data,
justifying the addition in complexity that their addition involves (and
their reduction in degrees of freedom).

\[
\left[ \begin{matrix} { \sigma  }_{ 1 }^{ 2 } & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & { \sigma  }_{ 2 }^{ 2 } & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & { \sigma  }_{ 3 }^{ 2 } & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & { \sigma  }_{ 4 }^{ 2 } \end{matrix} \right] 
\]

\subsubsection{Varying means, equal variances, and equal covariances
(model
2)}\label{varying-means-equal-variances-and-equal-covariances-model-2}

This model corresponds to the mclust model ``EEE''. In this model, the
variances are still constrained to be the same across the profiles,
although now the covariances are estimated (but like the variances, are
constrained to be the same across profiles). Thus, this model is the
first to estimate the covariance (or correlations) of the variables used
to create the profiles, thus adding more information that can be used to
better understand the characteristics of the profiles (and, potentially,
better explain the data).

\[
\left[ \begin{matrix} { \sigma  }_{ 1 }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 21 } & { \sigma  }_{ 31 } & { \sigma  }_{ 41 } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 2 }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 23 } & { \sigma  }_{ 24 } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 13 } & { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 3 }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 33 } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 14 } & { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 4 }^{ 2 } \end{matrix} \right] 
\]

\subsubsection{Varying means, varying variances, and covariances fixed
to 0 (model
3)}\label{varying-means-varying-variances-and-covariances-fixed-to-0-model-3}

This model corresponds to the mclust model ``VVI'' and allows for the
variances to be freely estimated across profiles. The covariances are
constrained to zero. Thus, it is more flexible (and less parsimonious)
than model 1, but in terms of the covariances, is more constrained than
model 2.

\[ 
\left[ \begin{matrix} { \sigma  }_{ 1p }^{ 2 } & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & { \sigma  }_{ 2p }^{ 2 } & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & { \sigma  }_{ 3p }^{ 2 } & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & { \sigma  }_{ 4p }^{ 2 } \end{matrix} \right] 
\]

\subsubsection{Varying means, varying variances, and equal covariances
(model
4)}\label{varying-means-varying-variances-and-equal-covariances-model-4}

This model, which specifies for the variances to be freely estimated
across the profiles and for the covariances to be estimated to be equal
across profiles, extends model 3. Unfortunately, this model cannot be
specified with mclust, though it can be with MPlus; this model
\emph{can} be used with the functions to interface to MPlus described
below.

\[
\left[ \begin{matrix} { \sigma  }_{ 1p }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 21 } & { \sigma  }_{ 31 } & { \sigma  }_{ 41 } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 2p }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 23 } & { \sigma  }_{ 24 } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 13 } & { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 3p }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 33 } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 14 } & { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 12 } & { \sigma  }_{ 4p }^{ 2 } \end{matrix} \right] 
\]

\subsubsection{Varying means, equal variances, and varying covariances
(model
5)}\label{varying-means-equal-variances-and-varying-covariances-model-5}

This model specifies the variances to be equal across the profiles, but
allows the covariances to be freely estimated across the profiles. Like
model 4, this model cannot be specified with mclust, though it can be
with MPlus. Again, this model \emph{can} be used with the functions to
interface to MPlus described below.

\[
\left[ \begin{matrix} { \sigma  }_{ 1 }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 21p } & { \sigma  }_{ 31p } & { \sigma  }_{ 41p } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 12p } & { \sigma  }_{ 2 }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 23p } & { \sigma  }_{ 24p } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 13p } & { \sigma  }_{ 12p } & { \sigma  }_{ 3 }^{ 2 } & { \sigma  }_{ 33p } \\ { \sigma  }_{ 14p } & { \sigma  }_{ 12p } & { \sigma  }_{ 12p } & { \sigma  }_{ 4 }^{ 2 } \end{matrix} \right] \quad 
\]

\subsubsection{Varying means, varying variances, and varying covariances
(model
6)}\label{varying-means-varying-variances-and-varying-covariances-model-6}

This model corresponds to the mclust model ``VVV''. It allows the
variances and the covariances to be freely estimated across profiles.
Thus, it is the most complex model, with the potential to allow for
understanding many aspects of the variables that are used to estimate
the profiles and how they are related. However, it is less parsimonious
than all of the other models, and the added parameters should be
considered in light of how preferred this model is relative to those
with more simple specifications.

\subsection{Appendix D: Additional details on the model selection
process}\label{appendix-d-additional-details-on-the-model-selection-process}

Looking across the statistics presented, some general ideas about which
models are to be preferred emerge. Solutions are interpreted first for
each model individually and then across models with the goal of choosing
a smaller number of models to investigate in more detail.

For solutions associated with model 1, the decrease (indicating a
preferred model) in information criteria becomes smaller as the number
of profiles increases from 5 to 6 and 6 to 7. A solution associated with
8 profiles did not replicate the log-likelihood and the VLMR and LMR
suggest that the solution associated with 9 profiles did not fit better
than that with 8 profiles, suggesting that models with 7 or fewer
profiles be preferred. Considering these models, the entropy statistic
increases by a large amount between the solution associated with 4 and 5
profiles (and then decreases slightly between 5 and 6 and 6 and 7
profile solutions), suggesting (but not providing conclusive evidence)
that models 5, 6, or 7 may be preferred. The bootstrapped LRT suggests
that, until the log-likelihood is not replicated, every more complex
model be selected. Taking these pieces of evidence into conclusion, for
model 1, solutions associated with 4 through 7 may be considered in more
depth, with an emphasis on solutions associated with profiles with 5 and
6 profiles on the basis of the slowing of the decrease in the
information criteria associated with the solutions with greater profiles
than these, and the increase in the entropy from 4 to 5 (and 6) profile
solutions.

For solutions associated with model 2, only those associated with 2-5
profile solutions were associated with log-likelihoods that were
replicated. For these four models, the log-likelihood decreased in a
mostly consistent way, such that changes in the decrease are not as
evident as those associated with model 1. The entropy statistic
decreases from 2 to 3 profile solutions, increases from 3 to 4 profile
solutions, and then decreases slightly from 4 to 5 profile solutions,
providing some information that models associated with 4 profiles be
preferred to the others. All of the LRTs suggest that the more complex
model be selected, not providing clear information about which solutions
are to be preferred. On the basis of these pieces of evidence, models
with 3, 4, and 5 solutions may be considered in more depth. However,
there is a lack of consistent evidence favoring more or less complex
models.

The model 1, six and seven profile solutions are compelling because both
show profiles that are distinguished by dimensions of engagement and its
conditions (challenge and competence). Note that for this model, only
the means and variances are estimated (and so no covariances are
estimated), and the variances are constrained to be the same across the
profiles. While this is a very restrictive model, it, along with the
model 3 type (which did not lead to solutions for any of the numbers of
profiles specified) also is a standard model for LPA, in that it meets
the assumption of local independence (of the variables that make up the
profiles--unlike for models in which covariances are estimated) typical
common to LPA (see Muthen \& Muthen, 2016). While some of the solutions
associated with the model 2 type did reach solutions, these demonstrated
less appealing properties in terms of their fit statistics as well as
their interpretability and with respect to concerns of parsimony. Thus,
while no covariances are estimated for the model 1 type solutions, there
is no requirement that these be specified; their benefit, when models
associated with them are preferred, is that they can provide better fit:
they can be used to better explain or predict the data in a sample, but
their inclusion also means that over-fitting the model to the data can
become a greater concern.

For each solution, alternate solutions associated with higher
log-likelihoods were explored. One advantage of the six profile solution
is that most of its profiles can also be identified in solutions with
fewer profiles. For the six profile solutions, this alternate solution
was very different, whereas for the seven profile solutions, this
alternate solution was highly similar. The model solutions exhibit a
less clear pattern in terms of which profiles appear when. All else
being equal, on the basis of parsimony, the model 1, six profile
solution is preferred and was selected for use in subsequent analyses.

\subsection{Appendix E: Alternate model selected (model type 1, seven
profile
solution)}\label{appendix-e-alternate-model-selected-model-type-1-seven-profile-solution}

This solution is characterized by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \emph{full} profile, profile 7
\item
  A \emph{universally low} profile, profile 1
\item
  A \emph{competent but not engaged or challenged} profile, profile 2,
  characterized by high competence and moderate (low) or low levels of
  engagement and challenge
\item
  A \emph{moderately low} profile, profile 3, characterized by
  moderately low levels of all of the variables
\item
  A \emph{challenged} profile, profile 4, characterized by high
  challenge, moderate (high) levels of engagement, and moderate (low)
  levels of competence
\item
  A \emph{highly challenged} profile, profile 5, characterized by
  patterns similar to those of the challenged profile, but with higher
  challenge and with low levels of both engagement and challenge
\item
  A \emph{challenged but not engaged or competent} profile, profile 6,
  characterized by low levels of challenge, and high levels of
  engagement and competence
\end{itemize}

The number of observations associated with each of the profiles is not
very balanced, with few (\emph{n} = 181) observations associated with
the universally low profile and few (\emph{n} = 222) observations
associated with the highly challenged profile. The number of
observations associated with the other profiles ranged from 317 to 651.
Distinct from other solutions, none of the other five profiles were
found in the other model 1 solutions. Two pairs of the
profiles--challenged and highly challenged and universally low and
moderately low--exhibited similar patterns among the variables that were
distinguished by different mean levels. The log-likelihood was
replicated twice, with the next lowest log-likelihood being replicate
four times, possibly warranting further investigation. Taken together,
this solution raises questions about whether it may be too complex,
possibly suggesting preference for model 1 five and six profile
solutions.
