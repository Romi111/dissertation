-they spend a very long time setting up the activity (where they pretend a tub of water is the ""Red River"" and follow how it changes from presettlement to development), sadly right as they start the activity, they are signaled to take the survey
- it seems strange that this clip was not coded for observing (as they were observing the teacher point to the map and talk about the rivers in their state) but they did code this clip for modeling, which this clip shows a lot of set up for using the model to explain phenomenon but do not actually get to the activity","- instructor talking a map at the front of the class and asking the students STEM-related questions about it (concerning the water percentages,land, tributatries) (communicating)
 instructor asks the students the difference between state and federal law, instructor asks questions about the clean water act and relating acts
- instructor gives studentsinstructions about their interactive learning they will be doing regarding water sheds
- students distributing materials to the rest of the class
- students given about four different kinds of liquids; told that they will do an experiment to follow a river from pre-settlment to development (modeling)"

- Students look at models and how it is changing- also writes them down. Code: Observe
-""If I drink this would I die?""  Code: Asking
- Students continue to work with the poluted water model. Code: Model
- Students discuss the observations they are making. Code: Communicate","-the students are modeling what the Red River would look like through stages in the cities development around it. During each stage, the students add a liquid to the tub of water and the teacher asks them questions about how they might want to interact with the river (i.e. would you swim in it?)
-the students add contaminates to the water as the teacher tells a ""story"" about how these things came to be in the river and the effect it has on the river and the creatures in it (it does not seem like the students are writing anything or recording data, only thinking about the effects these things have on the river and observing the water in their tubs)
-signal in the middle of clip (5:30)
-after students have put all their materials in the tub of water, they are given pencils and paper to write down their observations
----I think the ""generating data"" code must have either come from the students putting the liquids into the tub OR from when they actually wrote down their observations
-they are also discussing their observations with each other and with the teachers","- it seems like the students put materials (coke, etc.) into the water, and instructor asks the students if they would swim it (asking, modeling)
- instructor gives the students context: ""city is now the most developed city..."", describes the people and what they are doing to pollute the water including fertilizer, pouring antifreeze on the ground, washing the car, disposing medications, disposing hazardous material, trash
- instructor asks students if they have put all of their materials in the river, asks students to write down observations (generating)
- students take survey
- students write observations about the 'polluted' water including whether they think it is acidic or basic, smells, looks; instructor asks them questions about their observations (communicating)"

Disagree: ""generate"", ""observe"", ""model""","-students are asking their own questions about the topic without being prompted (asking questions)
-teacher is leading students to think about social change and how they can help enact their own social change to help save the bay
-not sure why they coded this clip for generating data, the rest of the clip they are just in transition time (going to the bathroom, preparing for snack time)","- student asks ""jhow do you know if it goes to the plant?"" (maybe talking about water) (asking)
- instructor raises question ""would people be more cautious about what they are putting in their water if they know where it went?"" and students give their subjective replies (communicating)
- instructor and students discuss why they are not using a solution that would work and how money and support plays into it (instructor and students ask questions and give answers); discusses social change and how it happens (generating, modeling)
