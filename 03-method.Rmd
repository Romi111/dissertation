In recognition of the challenge of studying engagement in learning environments where factors related to activities, learners, and each of the nine programs all interact at the same time, this study uses a methodological approach suited to studying engagement as a dynamic, multi-faceted experience. Specifically, this study employs the Experience Sampling Method (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007) where learners answer short questions about their experience when signaled. This approach is both sensitive to changes in engagement over time, as well as between learners and allows us to understand engagement and how factors impact it in more nuanced and complex ways (Turner & Meyer, 2000).

## Participants

Participants consist of 203 youth. Youth in these programs are from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (see Table 1). Most participants are around 13 years old (from youth whose age was available: *M* = 12.71, *SD* = 1.70, *min.* = 10.75, *max.* = 16.36). Detailed demographic characteristics of learners are presented in the table.

## Context	

The setting for this study is nine out-of-school STEM programs designed around best practices in urban areas in the Northeast United States during the summer of 2015. These are described in the appendix with pseudonyms for the program names. Two intermediary organizations contracted by the urban area school districts to administer the summer programs. The two intermediaries were responsible for soliciting and enrolling youth; establishing guidelines for the design of the programs, and the goals of the programs; and provide training and professional development for the program’s staff. A key difference between the intermediary organizations was that one separated academic and enrichment-related activities, whereas, in another, which was more closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the program, the academic and enrichment components were more integrated, which may have program-specific effects on learners’ engagement. Many of the programs aim to involve learners in work with data. These learning environments bring together youth activity leaders, educators, and those with technical expertise in STEM domains. Youth spent around three hours per day for four days per week for the approximately four-week programs, which were taught by youth activity leaders and scientists, engineers, and other community members with technical expertise. 

## Procedure

Youth completed a pre-survey before the program. Youth also completed pre-course surveys of their experience in STEM, intention to pursue a STEM major or career, and questions for other motivation and engagement-related measures. At the beginning of the programs, youth were introduced to the study and the phones used for data collection related to the ESM. ESM data were collected two days each week, for three weeks (weeks 2-4 of the program). In all of the programs, about equal video-recording time was dedicated to classroom and field experiences. This detail is important because programs associated with one of the intermediaries rotated between classroom and field experience days, while the other used the first half of each day for one (i.e., classroom activities) or the other (i.e., field experience days). 

Each day, youth were signaled four times. These signals were at the same time for all of the youth within their program, but at different times between programs and between days within programs (with the constraint that no two signals could occur less than ten minutes apart). All of the programs were video-recorded by research team members and on three occasions research team members also recorded detailed field notes on the nature of program activities. So that measures corresponding to the video and ESM data can be matched, videos include a signal from the video-recorder identifying the ESM signal to which youth responded at that point in the video. 

In a reflection of the dynamic conceptualization of engagement, this study uses data collected from ESM. As such, learners are prompted at regular intervals to respond to short questions about their perceptions of their engagement and its influencers. Though time-consuming to carry out, ESM can be a powerful measure that leverages the benefits of both observational and self-report measures, allowing for some ecological validity and the use of closed-form questionnaires amenable to quantitative analysis (Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1987). Despite the logistic challenge of carrying out ESM in large studies, some scholars have referred to it as the “gold standard” for understanding individual’s subjective experience (Schwarz, Kahneman, & Xu, 2009). This approach has the benefit of measuring learners’ engagement at a fine grain-size: Changes in the activity on learners’ engagement, even within the same session of the program, and changes in how influencers of engagement impact engagement and how the activity may relate to engagement, can be measured. 

## Data Sources and Measures

Data sources consist of self-reported ESM measures of engagement and learners’ perceptions of themselves and the activity, pre-survey measures of youths’ interest, youths’ demographic information, and video-recordings of programs. 

### ESM measures of learners’ engagement and its conditions for the profiles

Measures for engagement and its conditions were constructed from three ESM responses for engagement and two ESM responses for the conditions of engagement. The three variables for engagement are for learning (for the cognitive engagement construct), working hard (for behavioral engagement), and enjoying (for affective engagement). The variables for the conditions are for perceived challenge and perceived competence. All five items are used to construct PECs. Each of the ESM items consisted of the item text and the following four item response options, of which youth were directed to select one: Not at all (associated with the number 1 on the survey), A little (2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much (4), as presented in Table 3. 

```{r}
d <- tibble::tribble(
               ~Construct,                                                                         ~Item.text,
   "Cognitive engagement", "As you were signaled, were you learning anything or getting better at something?",
  "Behavioral engagement",                                 "As you were signaled, how hard were you working?",
   "Affective engagement",                          "As you were signaled, did you enjoy what you are doing?",
    "Perceived challenge",                     "As you were signaled, how challenging was the main activity?",
   "Perceived competence",                        "As you were signaled, were you good at the main activity?"
  )

d %>% 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "ESM measures for profiles of engagement and its conditions (PECs)") %>% 
    kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")

```

### Survey measures of pre-interest

Measures of youths’ pre-interest are used as youth-level influencers of PECs. In particular, three items adapted from Vandell, Hall, O’Cadiz, and Karsh (2012) were used, with directions for youth to rate their agreement with the items’ text using the same scale as the ESM items: Not at all (associated with the number 1 on the survey), A little (2), Somewhat (3), and Very Much (4). The measure was constructed by taking the maximum value for the scales for the different content areas (science, mathematics, and engineering), so that the value for a youth whose response for the science scale was 2.5 and for the mathematics scale was 2.75 would be 2.5. The items are presented in Table 4.

```{r}
d <- tibble::tribble(
                     ~Construct,                                                            ~`Items.text`,
  "Individual interest in STEM",               "I am interested in science / mathematics / engineering.",
                             NA,                 "At school, science / mathematics / engineering is fun",
                             NA, "I have always been fascinated by science / mathematics / engineering)"
  )

### Codes from video-recordings for work with data

Different aspects of work with data are identified from video-recordings with the use of a coding frame with five for each of the aspects of work with data. These codes are developed from the STEM-Program Quality Assessment (STEM-PQA; Forum for Youth Investment, 2012), an assessment of quality programming in after school programs.	For the PQA, raters contracted by American Institute of Research (AIR) were trained in the use of the PQA measure during February, 2017. Raters completed a four-hour online training module on the overall PQA tool and then attended an in-person two-day training led by a trainer from the David P. Weikart Center for Youth Program Quality, the tool’s publisher, where they learned about the instrument, trained on its use, and then established inter-rater reliability with a master coder. For the STEM-PQA, three of the same raters contracted by AIR to overall PQA measure used the STEM-PQA scored one video segment, for which there were no disagreements on scoring across the four raters on any items. If any of the raters encountered into a situation that was difficult to score, they would all discuss the issue by telephone or more often by email after viewing the video in question and reach a consensus on how to score the specific item. Programs were divided up among all of the raters, so raters coded some of the videos for all of the programs.

 Specific details on how the measure aligns with the original STEM-PQA on which this measure is based are presented in the appendix.

### Demographic variables used
 
In addition to the measures described in this section, demographic information for youths’ gender and their racial and ethnic group are used to construct demographic variables for gender and membership in an under-represented (in STEM) group; membership in an under-represented group are identified on the basis of youths’ racial and ethnic group being Hispanic, African American, Asian or Pacific Islanders, or native American. 

## Data Analysis

The steps for both preliminary and the primary analyses are described in this section.

### Preliminary analyses

First-order Pearson correlations, frequency, range, mean, skew, kurtosis, and standard deviations are examined for all variables including ESM measures for challenge, competence, cognitive, behavioral and affective engagement, and for the pre-survey measure for interest. In addition, the frequency of the codes for aspects of work with data, and the numbers of responses by youth, program, and moment is examined.

### Analysis for Research Question #1

First, the frequency of the codes for work with data (and the composite code) are calculated. Then, to present a qualitative description, all of the segments were coded, moments associated with specific codes were identified and used to provide examples for each of the aspects of work with data.

To code the data, three research assistants were trained for approximately eight hours over four meetings. Then, each research assistant coded all of the segments associated with one of the videos. After the coding was complete, the three research assistants and I met to discuss how well the coding frame and potential sources of disagreement. Then, two coders coded every segment that was coded for at least one of the aspects of work with data. This coding took around 75 hours of coding by the research assistants. After each program, the coders met to discuss potential issues that emerged throughout the coding, and to clarify how they applied the coding frame. As this was open-ended coding with the aim to provide greater detail and context for the findings associated with research questions #2 and #3, establishing reliability among the coders was not carried out. The coders sought to document a) the characteristics of work with data and b) other aspects of the instructional context that impacts student work with data.

### Analysis for Research Question #2

#### Background on creating profiles using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)

This question addresses what profiles emerged from the data. This section first provides fit statistics for models that converged and for which the log-likelihood was replicated are described, followed by a comparison of specific, candidate solutions. At the end of this section, models selected are described in detail. Note that while the posterior probability was used as the outcome, there are two approaches to their use in subsequent analyses. One way is to only use the largest posterior probability, setting the other posterior probabilities to a value of zero; in this way, the uncertainty in the profile assignment is accounted for, but partial assignment to other profiles is not considered in their use in subsequent models. The other way is to use the posterior probabilities for all of the subsequent models. In this analysis, the latter option is used: posterior probabilities are used as-is (i.e., none are assigned to zero), though the former approach was used and was found to yield comparable results.

To answer this question, PECs are constructed using on the basis of five variables: cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and learners’ perceptions of challenge and competence. Answers to this question will help to understand how the aspects of engagement relate to both one another and to key conditions that influence engagement. 

To create PECs, a mixture modeling approach is carried out. Mixture modeling is an approach for identifying distinct distributions, or mixtures of distributions, of measured variables. A type of mixture modeling within a latent variable modeling framework, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA; Harring & Hodis, 2016; Muthen, 2004) is used in this study, in particular, to identify the number and nature of PECs. LPA allows for capturing the multidimensional nature of engagement. From this approach, different parameters - means, variances, and covariances - are freely estimated across profiles, fixed to be the same across profiles, or constrained to be zero. In order to provide results for this research question, the MPlus software (Muthen & Muthen, 2017) was used. While MPlus is powerful and widely-used, it can be very difficult to use as part of complex analyses. One reason for why it is difficult to use is that while it provides an environment for executing model *syntax*, it is not an environment, such as SPSS or R, for statistical computing (i.e., preparing data, processing and presenting results). Because of this, I created with colleagues an open-source tool, tidyLPA (Rosenberg, Schmidt, Beymer, & Steingut, 2018  in the statistical software R (R Core Team, 2018). This package is available on the R Comprehensive Archive Network (CRAN). This software provides wrappers--functions that provide an interface--to MPlus functions via the MplusAutomation R package (Hallquist, 2018). It also provides an interface to open-source functions for carrying out LPA that can be used to compare results to those from MPlus. 

LPA can be used to identify common patterns in learners’ ESM responses as part of a person-oriented analysis to construct PECs. These profiles make it possible to analyze the multivariate data collected on engagement in a way that balances the parsimony of a single model for all learners with a recognition of individual differences in how learners’ experience each of the dimensions of engagement together at the same time. A key benefit of the use of LPA, in addition to likelihood estimation-based fit indices, is probabilities of an observation being a member of a cluster, unlike in hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis, for which an observation is hard classified exclusively into one cluster. 

#### Selecting a model on the basis of fit indices and other techniques

As part of LPA, different models that determine whether and how different parameters (i.e., means, variances, and covariances) are estimated. In addition, the number of profiles to estimate must be provided by the analyst. Determining the number of profiles depends on fit statistics (such as information criteria and the entropy statistic) as well as concerns of parsimony and interpretability. In general, the approach to choosing the model is similar to choosing the number of profiles, requiring deciding on the basis of evidence from multiple sources. The models are described in-depth in the appendix.

Profiles are constructed with the five self-reported ESM measures for cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement and perceptions of challenge and competence. Once this step is carried out, the probability of a response being associated with a profile of engagement and its conditions are used as the dependent variable for subsequent analyses. An interface to the MCLUST software was developed and used to carry out the LPA. The number of profiles are determined on the basis of the log-likelihood and bootstrapped likelihood ratio test, entropy, Akaike Information Criteria, and Bayesian Information Criteria statistics, as well as concerns of parsimony and interpretability. This analysis can help us to understand how patterns in higher or lower levels of the variables used to construct the profiles group together in PECs, providing insight into both how engagement is commonly experienced as a meta-construct as well as how key conditions influence engagement. 

First, I examined a wide range of model types (i.e., the parameterization of the model) and the numbers of profiles. Note that six model types are able to be specified. These roughly became more complex, with additional parameters estimated, as the number for the model type increases from one to six.

This step is taken to select candidate solutions to investigate in more detail. In order to carry out this analysis, I followed guidelines recommended by the developers of the MPlus software (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2012; Muthen & Muthen,dfs 2017) as well as those making recommendations about its use (Geiser, 2012). In particular, I set the number of starts to 600 for initial stage starts, and to 120 for the number of starts to be optimized. This means that for each model estimated, 600 random starting values for the parameters were used to initialize the EM algorithm. Of these 600, 120 that demonstrated the lowest log-likelihood were allowed to continue until they reached convergence or the limit for the number of iterations. In order for a model to me considered trustworthy, of these 120 runs, the lowest log-likelihood must be replicated at least one time.

If the log-likelihood is not replicated, then the estimation completed one or more times, but because the same log-likelihood value (and parameter estimates) were not obtained, then the solution can be considered to be "under-identified", a term used to describe solutions that depend strongly upon minor fluctuations in the data (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2007). Accordingly, these solutions may not represent meaningful values and may not be replicable in light of very small changes to the data; these are not considered as candidate solutions for use in subsequent analyses. If no log-likelihood is obtained for any of the random starts, then the software returns an error; in these cases, the convergence criteria--values that determine when a solution has been obtained--are not met. This may be due to a large number of parameters that are estimated relative to the data, such that the number of iterations that the estimation is allowed to go through are not sufficient to obtain a solution (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2007). Like when the log-likelihood is not replicated, these solutions are not considered for use in subsequent analyses.

For every combination of models one through six and from two through ten profiles, only solutions associated with model specifications 1 and 2 (and among these two solutions, only those associated with particular number of profiles) converged. Thus, only solutions associated with models 1 (the model with varying means, equal variances, and covariances fixed to zero) and model 2 (varying means, equal variances, and equal covariances) are explored in subsequent sections. This suggests that the more complex models were too complex given the systematic variability in the data used for the analysis.

After investigating the general information about a range of model solutions, solutions associated with models 1 and 2 are explored in greater detail, following recommendations associated with mixture modeling (Collins and Lanza, 2009; Geiser, 2012) and the authors of the MPlus software (Muthen & Muthen, 2017) as well as recent peer-reviewed articles (Pastor et al., 2007). For these models, the log-likelihood (LL), a range of information criteria (AIC, BIC, sample adjusted BIC [SABIC], consistent AIC [CAIC]), statistics about the quality of the profile assignments (entropy, which represents the mean posterior probability) are presented.

The information criteria are based on the log-likelihood but take various steps to penalize complex models, and so can be used to directly compare models (i.e., the model with the lowest values for these statistics can be considered to better reflect the underlying properties of the profiles). Simulation studies have suggested that BIC, CAIC, SABIC, and BLRT are most helpful for selecting the correct number of profiles (Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muthen, 2007). For the entropy statistic, higher values are considered better, though scholars have suggested that the entropy statistic not be used for model selection (Lubke & Muthen, 2007).The log-likelihood should not be interpreted directly but is presented in conjunction with the information criteria for context about how each of them differs from the log-likelihood. These are also presented in the figures.

In addition to these statistics, a number of modified likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are used, as the test statistics associated with unmodified LRT do not follow the distribution that the test is based on (Muthen & Muthen, 2017). These are the Vu-Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT, Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT, and the bootstrapped LRT. Of the three, the bootstrapped is considered to be the best indicator of which of two models, one nested (with certain parameters fixed to 0) within the other, fits better, but it is also the most computationally-intensive to carry out (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2012). For each of the LRTs, the test statistic and its associated p-value are provided; a p-value greater than .05 suggests that the model with fewer profiles should be preferred.

### Statistical software developed

The MPlus software is used to carry out LPA as part of this study. In order to more flexibly carry out LPA, an open-source tool, tidyLPA (Rosenberg, Schmidt, Beymer, Steingut, van Lissa, & Anderson, 2018), was developed. This tool provides interfaces to both the MPlus software and to the open-source mclust software. In addition to being used as part of this study, this package is provided free of use to other analysts as the first tool dedicated to carrying out LPA as part of the R software. More details on the statistical software developed and included in the Appendix.

### Analysis for Research Question #3

Broadly, this question is focused on how work with data, as coded from video-recordings of the programs, relates to the PECs. For the primary results for this question, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and youth are used and for the "nesting" of both within each of the nine programs are used. For the outcome (*y* variable), the probability of a response belonging to the profile is used; thus, there are six models, for each of the six profiles, for each specification of the predictor (*x*) variables.

Null models showing the proportion of variance (via the intra-class correlation) are interpreted. The more detailed results (in a table) are presented in the appendix. These are followed by the interpretation of findings related to a more variable-centered approach, namely, correlations between individual aspects of work with data and the composite and the profiles (and the variables that make them up) and individual interest. Finally, results of mixed effects models with the work with data variables added separate and then with the composite for work with data are interpreted and presented.

To answer this question, on how well the aspects of work with data predict the PECs, first, indicators for activities coded for any of the five aspects of work with data and either of the other two activities are used to predict each PEC. Next, how each of the five aspects of work with data, as well as the other activities, predict each PEC are explored. Due to similarity in the mixed-effects models used to analyze data to answer Research question #2 and #3, the data analysis strategy for these steps is described together here. First, the general approach used for specifying the mixed effects is first described, followed by details about how the models are used to provide answers to the specific research questions.

The lme4 R package is used (Bates, Martin, Bolker, & Walker, 2015). All of the models use random effects for learner, momentary, and program effects. Learner and moment can be considered to be crossed with both nested within the program. Because the outcome from LPA is not a hard classification (i.e., an observation is in a profile—or not) but a probability, the outcome is treated as a continuous variable. There are as many models as profiles identified in the preliminary analysis. A bottom-up model-building process (West, Welch, & Galecki, 2014), in which a more complex model is constructed on the basis of and continually compared to a more simple model, is used. 

First, null models with only the random parts (i.e., random learner, momentary, and program effects) are specified. Then, the predictors are added to the model with the main effects of the variables added to the null mixed effects model. The main effects are for the aspects of work with data and instructional support for the aspects of work with data as well as individual interest in STEM (as a control variable). Note that the interaction between individual interest in STEM and the aspects of work with data is added in a separate step, as described in the next section. The model with the random effects for the learner, moment, and program and with the direct effects of all the predictor variables is presented below.

Here, the probability of a response being associated with a profile is predicted by the direct effects of indicators for the aspects of instructional support work with data measured at the momentary level, their individual interest in STEM measured at the youth level, and the random learner, moment, and program effects.

The general specification for the models for learner i during moment j in program k is written as [i:

$$
For\quad learner\quad i\quad during\quad moment\quad j\quad in\quad program\quad k:\\ \\ Pr({ { profile }_{ ijk })\quad =\quad  }\\ \\ Fixed\quad parts:\\ \\ { \beta  }_{ 00 }\quad +\\ { { \beta  }_{ 01 }(Indicator\quad for\quad support\quad for\quad asking\quad questions) }_{ j }\quad +\\ { { \beta  }_{ 02 }(Indicator\quad for\quad support\quad for\quad making\quad observations) }_{ j }\quad +\\ { { \beta  }_{ 03 }(Indicator\quad for\quad support\quad for\quad generating\quad data) }_{ j }\quad +\\ { { \beta  }_{ 04 }(Indicator\quad for\quad support\quad for\quad data\quad modeling) }_{ j }\quad +\\ { { \beta  }_{ 06 }(Dummy\quad code\quad for\quad female\quad gender) }_{ i }\quad +\\ { { \beta  }_{ 07 }(Dummy\quad code\quad for\quad member\quad of\quad under-represented\quad group) }_{ i }\quad +\\ { { \beta  }_{ 08 }(Pre-program\quad STEM\quad interest) }_{ i }\quad +\\ \\ Random\quad parts:\\ \\ { \alpha  }_{ learner }(Youth\quad effect)_{ i }\quad +\\ { { { \alpha  }_{ moment } }(Momentary\quad effect) }_{ j }\quad +\\ { { \alpha  }_{ program }(Program\quad effect) }_{ k }\quad +\\ { \varepsilon  }_{ ijk }\\ \\ Where\quad { \alpha  }_{ learner },\quad { \alpha  }_{ moment },\quad and\quad { \alpha  }_{ program }\quad are\quad assumed\quad to\quad vary \quad N({ { \mu  }_{ \alpha  } },\quad { \sigma  }_{ \alpha  }^{ 2 })

### Analysis for Research Question #4

Research question #4 is focused on how the relationships of work with data differ on the basis of pre-program interest and other youth characteristics. Like for the previous two research questions, linear models that account for the cross-classification of the moment and the youth--and their nesting within the programs--are used. Findings from models with pre interest, gender, and URM status are first presented. Then, models with these variable and the individual aspects and composite of work with data are added and then models with the interaction between these characteristics and the composite.

To answer this question, on how youth characteristics impacts relationships between work with data and the PECs, the direct effects of pre-program interest in STEM, gender, and under-represented minority [URM] status, without other predictor variables, were explored. Then, models with these variables and the composite variable for work with data was specified.These analyses were carried out separately for relations between work with data (on its own, corresponding to the analyses carried out for Research question #3) and work with data with instructional support (for Research question #4). Next, for any specific aspect of work with data that significantly predicts each PEC, the same were carried out, so that the interaction between individual interest in STEM and the specific aspect of work with data are used to predict each PEC. These interactions between individual interest in STEM and the dummy codes for aspects of work with data are added to the model specification for Research question #2. 

## Sensitivity Analysis

For observational studies, such as the present study, it can be important to determine how robust an inference is to alternative explanations. One approach to addressing this is sensitivity analysis, which involves quantifying the amount of bias that would be needed to invalidate an inference (hypothetically, this bias might be due to omitted or confounding variables, measurement, missing data, etc.). Using the approach described in Frank, Maroulis, Duong, and Kelcey (2013), I carried out sensitivity analysis for inferences we made relative to our key findings. I used the R package konfound (Rosenberg, Xu, & Frank, 2018). The result, and what is used to interpret and contextualize findings, is a numeric value for each effect that indicates the proportion of the estimate that would have to be biased in order to invalidate the inference: higher values indicate more robust estimates in that the inferences would still hold even if there were substantial bias in the estimate.
